2,TRUE,"As a fan of the books, and someone who once poured over the Silmarillion and the appendices trying to squeeze every drop out of my favorite world, what mattered most to me was the show staying true to the essence of the work which is, to me, about a deep love of beauty—a sniff of the air and a glimpse of the stars, a bit of poetry and song, the desire to live well and celebrate artistry, and ultimately the humble and vulnerable triumphing over violence. The lamentations of the Third Age focus on all that was fair and lost in the ages before. I felt that, clung to it as a kid who looked around and saw a world that was often shallow and devoid of meaning. 

What I see in the Rings of Power is almost miraculous to me, in that the show runners seem to have understood this quality and somehow managed to spend a half billion dollars on a TV show for Amazon that takes it seriously. There is wonder and love everywhere in these first two episodes and I felt respected, as an audience member who wants something slow, considered, and intentional. It’s a beautiful show. What was most touching to me is how the war goes on in Galadriel—I appreciate that they have given her incredible stakes, in terms of what she has lost and the unyielding compulsion of her grief. It makes her test in Fellowship that much more poignant. It isn’t perfect canon but it’s in the spirit and I want to embrace this jewel for what it offers.  Can’t wait for the rest.",138,1
2,TRUE,"I do appreciate the dwarfs' exclamations being to Aule. ""Thank Aule!"" ""Aule save us!"" Nice little touch there. I also liked the story about Morgoth staring at the Silmarils until he saw his own reflection in his tear.

In some places there's been good care taken. In others, less so! But I'm intrigued so far. Kinda neat seeing some of this stuff on screen with this level of production value.",83,2

If they were both created more lore-accurate, it would leave them both at the end of their character arcs, and that would just be plan bad tv/film.

However whilst the subtitles spell 'mana', the actor is pronouncing the word more like 'mána' which means 'blessing' or 'good thing'. However he does seem to be asking a question which matches more with the former translation.

Wonder what it could mean?

2,TRUE,"I was pretty disappointed yesterday but have simmered down and I’ll say this: the production value, the score and the overall cinematography of it is really good. At the very least, they have that part nailed.

But what really annoys me is the complete disregard for the existing characters they’re butchering and complete lack of background to anything and everything (although it seems like that was a given with their rights issues). 

The idea that Galadriel, who is older than Gil Galad and Elrond and is a daughter of Finarfin and revered in Elven culture would be out on some fucking scouting missions like a pleb with half a dozen other scouts in the wastes seems unlikely, but to be told she’s lucky to get an audience with the King? She was one of the first to see the greed and flaws taking hold in Feanor, she’s known as one of the most insightful and respected Elves ever, and she’s being spoken down to like some scrub? WTF.

The other thing that annoyed me character wise, was Galadriel talking to Elrond of “not knowing evil like I have”. Elrond was the sole survivor of one of the Kinslayings as a child, saw everyone of his kin murdered and was only spared to be raised by the last sons of Feanor who ordered the sack of his city. As if, she wouldn’t have known that?? 

Also why is Gil Galad a craggy looking old man and Galadriel a 20 something young girl? It seems like they’re going to ignore the entire history and social structure of the Elves and just change the characters to suit whatever new narrative they want to push. In this case, Galadriel warrior princess, who leads all their scouts and skirmishes into battle…

And the “Elf-lords only” smack down on Elrond as if he’s some pig shit farmer? My guy he is the son of Earendil the Mariner, the first half-elven to be allowed into Valinor who alerted them to the trouble in Middle Earth and the legendary figure who killed Ancalagon the Black. 

I just don’t understand the need to shit all over the history and standings of the characters in their universe.",38,14
2,TRUE,"Quick thoughts after episode 1:

* Production value is really good, especially by TV standards.

* Acting is generally very good. I felt that Morfydd Clark did a particularly good job of conveying a wide range of Galadriel's emotions with subtlety and stoicism.

* Really don't like the presentation of going to Valinor as a reward granted by Gil-galad. That's a pretty big change. And Elvish society in general seems much more...authoritarian? than I would expect. There's a lot of talk of orders, commands, disobeying the King, etc. 

* Dialogue is pretty good in parts but kind of uneven. The Elves, for example, seem to speak in a very formal register at times and a much more casual, modern register at other times within the same scene or even the same line. For example, at one point Elrond says to Galadriel, ""There will be ample time later to discuss official matters. I want to hear about you."" The modern, casual phrasing ""I want to hear about you"" makes the much more formal ""ample time to discuss official matters"" sound stilted to my ears. Ironically, if they had gone with a more classical, formal phrasing for the second sentence, say, ""Tell me rather of yourself,"" I think the first part would have stuck out less awkwardly. I counted several such examples. 

* Did anyone catch good examples of their use of ""heroic meters""? It struck me as very intermittent, which I expected, but I wasn't really focusing on counting iambs and trochees.

* The Harfoots are charming, but I can't say I'm a fan of the very fake-sounding Irish accents. I half expected one of them to declare ""They're after me Lucky Charms!"" at any moment. And I still really don't like the name *Elanor Brandyfoot*.

* This may be a question of my own assumptions, but I was expecting to see the *beginning* of Arondir and Bronwyn's friendship/romance, rather than meeting them when there already seems to be a ""spark"" between them. It made their attraction feel a little forced to me, but again that may just be that I had made unjustified assumptions.

* I much preferred the style of action they used with Finrod fighting in the prologue compared to Galadriel's acrobatics with the troll.

* What's with Arondir saying that the Elves call healers ""artificers""? The only mention I can remember of the word artificer is that Fëanor is called ""the chief artificer of the Elves"" in reference to his skill as a craftsman, not any healing abilities. On the other hand, Tolkien writes that, ""many elven-men were great healers and skilled in the lore of living bodies,"" and he frequently uses various forms of the word ""heal/healed/healing"" to apply to Elves, so it struck me as very odd that Arondir would claim that Elves don't use the word ""healer,"" especially when the term he replaces it with means something completely different. It's like saying, ""Yes, we Elves have shoes but we call them 'pants.'"" It's a nitpick, but inventing a new term for no real reason feels very fan-fiction to me.

Overall it had its highs and lows. I certainly plan to continue watching; I'm to see where they're going with some of these storylines. But I can't say I was blown away by the first episode.

EDIT: And to be clear, I think there was a lot of good, too. This may come off like I was looking for things to complain about, but that's really not the case - these were just things that jumped out at me. I'm not trying to convince myself or anyone else that the show is bad, but I'm also not trying to convince myself or anyone else that the show is good. I'm just watching and reporting my thoughts as they come to me.

2,TRUE,"My thoughts on episode 2 (thoughts on episode 1 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/x3qfr2/z/imt9yy8)):

* I really like the opening credits sequence

* Dialogue was better than episode 1 - not always perfect but far fewer clunky lines. I did note afterwards that episode 1 was written by McKay and Payne and episode 2 by Gennifer Hutchinson, so maybe dialogue is just not the showrunners' strong suit.

* Much has been said of the pace at which the show cuts between storylines, but the beginning of this episode really highlighted it. We see Galadriel for what, 10 seconds before cutting to the Harfoots?

* I have a new theory for the identity of Meteor Man: [Puff from *Human Nature*](https://images.static-bluray.com/reviews/23704_1_large.jpg). But in all seriousness something about his facial expression when he looks at Nori for the first time reminds me of Ian McKellen as Gandalf.

* On that note, I definitely see the hints that MM is Olorin (but why did the fireflies die then?) I would prefer him to be a blue wizard, but honestly based on how much they simplified the First Age and Valinor and how they seem to be using ""Lindon"" and ""Eregion"" as city names as well as the names of countries/regions, I think the blue wizards might be too deep of a cut for this show.

* I like the actor portraying Celebrimbor - you can sense his ambition and enthusiasm and it feels very fitting for the character. It's easy to imagine this version of the character falling into hubris and meeting his tragic end.

* What body of water is the city in Eregion (Ost-in-Edhil?) on? The wide view made it look almost like a coastal city, but I can't think of any body of water that big in the arwa, unless the Sirannon is just really wide there. Just curious if anyone has thoughts on the geography.

* Khazad-dûm design is very nice. I like the masked helmets of the guards. In general the dwarvish designs feel far more interesting than the cartoonish ones of the *Hobbit* movies.

* It's a very common issue with TV in general, but I *hate* when stakes are raised to generate fake tension and then lowered afterward so the characters don't really have to face the consequences (PJ also did this, e.g. with Aragorn falling off the cliff). It's cheap and, dare I say, lazy writing. So Elrond invokes this ancient dwarvish rite, he's told multiple times he will be banished forever if he loses, he loses, then he talks it out with Durin IV and Disa and he's not banished any more? It makes it feel like the whole rite wasn't a very serious thing after all. They should have given Elrond a penalty for losing that the writers were actually willing to make him pay.

* Still would have preferred (heavily) bearded dwarf women. But Disa's performance is very good.

* Disa says resonating can tell them ""where to leave the mountain untouched."" That's some pretty blatant foreshadowing, so with the Balrog in the teaser I would say Durin's Bane awakening is all but confirmed for the show. That's *way* too early for my taste, even by compressed timeline standards - he shouldn't awaken until TA 1980, nearly 2000 years after any of the other events we expect to happen in the show!

* The name Disa is obviously inspired by Dís (Thorin's sister), which is the only attested female Dwarf name we know. But why not just use Dís?

* Durin III as father of Durin IV confirmed, so that's a change. It works in the compressed timeline (if you don't buy the reincarnation theory) in the sense that Durin III was around about when the rings were forged and Durin IV was around at the end of the SA. But that's still kind of weird, like if they had both Tar-Minastir and Pharazôn in the same time period as father and son.

* I've seen people speculate that the box the Durin's open contains mithril, the Arkenstone, or even a Silmaril. But clearly it's [Marcellus Wallace's soul](https://i.redd.it/orwa82po3db31.jpg).

* Another kind of odd thing about the dwarvish rite is they called it ""the rite of *sigin-tarâg*,"" and *sigin-tarâg* just means ""long beards,"" i.e. Durin's Folk, in Khuzdul. It's kind of strange that they have a rite that's basically just named ""the rite of our people."" That would suggest that it's *extremely* important to Durin's Folk,  which again makes it strange that Durin just completely voids the consequences of it for Elrond.

Overall it seems that the show so far is mainly about the invented storylines with Tolkien's actual material as a loose framework. Virtually nothing in this episode corresponded to an event that Tolkien wrote about specifically. That's not a criticism - it was to be expected ever since we knew what time period the show would be set in. But it's still way to early to tell where these original storylines are going and how they'll engage with the major events of the Age. Will they develop into interesting, compelling stories, or will the writers rush their characters from plot point to plot point with little logic or motivation like the last couple seasons of Game of Thrones? It's too soon to tell.",31,16
2,TRUE,"Frankly, I think this is amazing so far. 

I am loving the lighter tone for all the races. Lots of world building. Amazing cinematography. Well written characters so far. 

I think too many people are seeing this through the brush strokes of the PJ movies and failing to understand that this is so far removed from the time LOTR happens. Also, it is two episodes out of a five season run. We have a lot of stories to see. 

I also feel it fits well with the tone the books portray. The happy moments feel happy, scary moments are scary, etc.",33,17
2,TRUE,"Why does celebrimbor look so much older than galadriel, isn't she one of the oldest elves present here?",28,18
2,TRUE,"Overall pretty good. Some Tolkien fans are criticising it with a fine tooth comb the you could also take to the LOTR trilogy, which also diverged from the books in some key ways, but we're generally used to those liberties 20 years later.

I'm impressed with overall production quality, in spite of the budget I was worried we'd get a WoT looking series. It's much better than that.

As a tv series, I just found the first couple episodes a bit flat. The Galadriel story line should have been the most gripping, but it just wasn't. Not sure why. Then otherwise, a whole lot of hopping around in the need to introduce everybody all at once. The plot needed a better early hook and maybe to take their time with the introductions, run them over several episodes so we can dig into the individual arcs a bit.

My only real canon-oriented beef would probably be the Elves feeling too human and not elf-like enough. Even the weird dynamic of sticking your head in the sand to just hope evil kind of disappears on its own. That's pretty much the opposite of elves in middle earth.",29,19
2,TRUE,"Just watched the first episode

Overall verdict: it exceeded my expectations, but not by much, and my expectations were low

The good:

\-	an attempt at Tolkienian writing, even if it often falls short of the mark

\-	it actually looks quite good

\-	The standard of the acting was much better than I expected

The bad:

\-	Gil-galad as a manipulative asshole with his head firmly buried in the sand, and Elrond as his lackey

\-	Badly mishandling the few Silmarillion references included. I mean, I get that they don’t own the rights, but still. ‘We went to Beleriand to fight Morgoth’ I can accept, as a ‘technically true’ whitewashing of history by Galadriel. But if the 'Galadriel’s brother' story is important, can we have it be, say, Angrod and Aegnor instead, and not have it be a character heavily implied to be Finrod Felagund, thereby taking a wet sloppy shit all over Beren and Luthien? How come the High King of the Noldor decides who gets to go back to Valinor (not Tol Eressea, Valinor)?

\-	More video-game style rubbish fight scenes, all style over substance

\-	‘Brandyfoot’

The ugly:

\-	Galadriel Noldorsplaining evil to Elrond like she hasn’t heard of the Third Kinslaying

\-	‘Fuck Celeborn’ – every adaptation

\-	Not another elf-mortal romance please. They’re rare, and important

\-	Who is meteor man? Whatever the answer is, I feel like I’m not going to like it. It doesn’t make sense for Sauron to have contact with Hobbits at this point, and it had better bloody not be one of the Istari.

\-	Didn’t know swimming to Middle-Earth was an option. Probably should have told Fëanor that before he started committing war crimes",28,20
2,TRUE,"It's meh for me. I don't feel super excited but I also don't think is bad. I'll wait to see how I feel about the remaining episodes.

My biggest disappointment is that women dwarf don't have large beautiful beards. But that's ok.",21,21
2,TRUE,I just don’t think the newly invented plot points are nearly as close to as interesting as to what is in the source material.,20,22
2,TRUE,"I actually had high expectations for the show and was excited for it, especially with all the recent glowing reviews! Now I'm just disappointed. The below is my opinion - nothing more nothing less. I have nothing about anyone who thoroughly enjoyed the first two episodes of the show, I'm actually really happy for and super jealous of you!

The good stuff first:

\- The show looks great, no denying it, it's beautiful

\- I am so happy to see a practical orc actually feeling powerful and scary and unstoppable

\- Khazad-dûm in all its glory was cool to see, and I liked the Elrond/Durin friendship. I loved the initial ""No!"" one word reply :)

\- Oooh using the discovery of Mithril as both a trigger for Elf/Dwarf collaboration and as a wedge between them sounds like a good idea! I hope that wasn't the Arkenstone otherwise I'll be really annoyed.

Bad stuff:

\-Overall it felt very derivative, like if I was watching an spin-off of the Elfstones of Shannara rather than something set in Arda

\- The dialogue lines try to sound smart but to me a lot of it felt cheap. Like yeah wind can spread a fire \*ominous music\* cut to Legolas having an epiphany ""A diversion!"". And stones vs boats.

\- I found myself bored, and I didn't really care for the storylines, except the Harfoots (Har*feet*!) because they're so darn cute, plus the Maia/Meteor man thing is intriguing. Still I was forcing myself to keep watching without looking at my phone, which is always a bad sign (despite watching on a big screen in VR, where looking at your phone is hard)

\- Since when is Gil-Galad a gatekeeper to Valinor? And since when is passage to Valinor a recompense for great deeds? It just really annoyed me (and I'm someone who really didn't mind the Elves at Helm's Deep)

\- As much as I like the Durin/Elrond friendship, the whole ""I invoke the right of *whatever*"" and smashing boulders for what felt like hours just felt stupid to me. Sure it was played for comedy (I guess?) but it didn't sit right with me.

\- So many small things that irk me. Let's stand in rows on ships, and for some reason some Elves are veiled servants for others and get them ready but get to go to Valinor anyway unless I missed something. Celebrimbor and Elrond casually strolling to the entrance of Khazad-dûm. No equipment, no luggage, no horse, no entourage, no nothing. Galadriel being an Olympic swimmer. When those small details are omitted it just helps remove a sense of grounded realism within a fictional world that I personally crave.

\- Fights and action scenes aren't interesting. I think it's because they don't tell a story nor add anything to the story. Contrast with Arcane (a series I just watched), where each fight scene actually tells a whole story, harks back to earlier plot points, or enhances the story.

It felt so artificial, and to me it recaptured none of the magic that the PJ movies (especially FotR) did (at least for LotR, and the first half of the first movie of The Hobbit).

Really a bummer. I'll try watching at again later - and I truly hope others enjoyed it!",21,23
2,TRUE,Why bother building ships to reach Valinor if you can simply swim there? #GaladrielaTheSwimmer,21,24
2,TRUE,"I found the first episode to be extremely boring and almost decided not to watch the second one, but I'm glad I did in the end because it was much more entertaning. They got me properly intrigued with the meteor man's identity, I have to admit. The dialogue also felt less wooden.

But I think I would've enjoyed it more if they had filmed it as an original piece. That way Elrond (Elrond! Son of Earendil, direct descendant of Melian) getting mistreated 'cause ""elf-lords only"" and other subtle lore discrepancies wouldn't bother me. Right now it feels like they took a bunch of popular fantasy tropes and shoved them into Arda where they, despite their popularity, simply do not belong. I have to keep reminding myself that I'm watching a very expensive piece of fanfiction, othwerwise these details take me out of the story.

What I liked: the cast (mostly; elderly Celebrimbor I just can't accept, even though the actor himself is good). The direction of architecture and costume design for the elves (execution could use some work) and dwarves (no complaints here, Khazad-dûm was gorgeous). Overall visuals and music are also nice.

What I really, really didn't like: there is no sense of scale to this world. Galadriel trying to cross an ocean without a boat, Elrond and Celebrimbor casually taking a stroll to Moria... did they receive a copy of Littlefinger's teleporting device? Because portrayal of travel and distances in this show is mid-GoT levels of bad.",20,25
2,TRUE,"Among a few issues, the thing that stood as a gaping kick in the face to the lore is the fact that Gil-Galad suddenly has the power to remove the curse of the Noldor from Galadriel, and send her to Valinor.

Yo dawg, you aren't a Valar. 

Basically everything with Galadriel is an absolute mess, even claiming that Finrod died hunting Sauron, well no he didn't, he died trying to save his friend, and uphold an oath, it's very different. He didn't have some silly penchant for revenge, and nor should she.

Celebrimbor and Elrond's castings are tragic.

The whole plot of Galadriel almost leaving to Valinor completely undermines the test of the ring during Fellowship of the Ring also.

I dunno, some things were nice, seeing the Southrons was cool, but it did way more damage than good.",17,26
2,TRUE,"My favourite series headcanon so far: 

1. Apparently you can swim from Valinor to Middle-Earth

2. The Kinslaying therefore never happened, and neither was the Ban placed on the Noldor

3. That's why Gil-Galad controls who goes to Valinor",15,27
2,TRUE,"Finrod looked great considering he was killed by a werewolf. Who dug him up after Beren and Luthien buried him?

The summary of the exile of the Noldor isn't great, and although cool as shit watching that eagle get roasted, was that a Fell Beast, like the thing Sauron makes for the Nazgul thousands of years after any battle Finrod was at? Morgoth doesn't loose the winged dragons until the War of Wrath, which the Noldor were excluded, and Finrod was dead by then. 

Where is Celeborn at?  If there is a meeting of elf lords surely he would be invited,no? Pretty sure the people of their shared feifdom might be a little pissed at Gil-galad deporting their lady to Valinor. 

This series is going to take a sledgehammer to the chronology, or it is going to need several serious time jumps. If they have no idea where Sauron is, then wouldn't that have to be at the latest sometime before the completion of the dark tower, so its hundreds of years before Annatar even shows up, half a millenia to the rings being made, and thousands of years before Elendil and Isildur.",15,28
2,TRUE,"Galadriel's backstory is butchered. There two options. One in which she hasn't met Celeborn yet. That's a big deviation and should be abhorred by everyone. The other option is that she was, until the very last moment, leaving her husband and daughter to certain death and doom in Middle Earth, with Sauron still around. This is counterproductive to her family-first personality with which she has with Finrod. So the show, even without the complaints of the production, acting or casting, is already bad for me.",18,29
2,TRUE,"I guess the target audience isn't people who've read *The Silmarillion* multiple times and own hardback copies of *The History of Middle-Earth* and weirdly re-read the *The Lost Tales*/*The Unfinished Tales* a lot, and that's ok.",16,30
2,TRUE,"Casual fan here: is it possible that Stranger is... Saruman? At first I thought he's Gandalf, first interaction with Harfoot (act of kindness) could be a reason for his later fondness of Hobbits. But there's something dark about this character, he doesn't show gratitude...",14,31
2,TRUE,"I loved the first two episodes for the most part. The aesthetics are great, the acting is good, and the music is amazing as well. My favorite acting part is how much subtlety and emotion Morfydd Clark shows in the peace ceremony. Her anger, frustration, and indignant acceptance are so well portrayed. However I have one huge problem with the first episode.

The dilemma that Galadriel faces, to return to middle earth, is framed in a way that misinterprets one of the major themes of the Lord of the Rings. The way they frame her choice with the quote ""sometimes we cannot know [what lights to follow], unless we have touched the darkness"" undermines the role that resisting temptation plays in LotR and her story in particular. In LOTR, the role of temptation is one that is always present, but should be avoided. It is not in itself necessary or beneficial.

Unless there's some major reframing of this event, the way this is portrayed just characterizes her rejection of Valinor as a necessary and beneficial choice, rather than an undergoing which allows for her return to Valinor.

Anyways, I don't really know if I can get across why I'm dissatisfied with this approach. However, I hope that someone else noticed this disconnection I see between the themes of power and temptation in the Lord of the Rings and this approach to Galadriel's character.

I will say though, I love how they are thematically setting up Celebrimbor. His first line ""true creation requires sacrifice"" is dripping with foreshadowing, character, and a juicy juxtaposition with Illuvitar's creation without sacrifice.

Edit:spelling",15,32
2,TRUE,"The lore makes a big deal out of sauron losing his physical form after the fall of numenor at the end of the second age. If he could regain a physical form  this wouldn't be a relevant plot point. This makes me think the meteor is unlikely to be sauron. If it is an istari, it will be gandalf or saruman. Gandalf was the second d istari sent to middle earth which would mean saruman is  already in play. However this relies on the series sticking with established lore, so...

I think gandalf is more likely as it is clearly forging a connection between the meteor man and the halflings.

Any thoughts?",16,33
2,TRUE,"Just finished watching the first two episodes. My opinion (as somebody who read the books + silmarillion).

The good:

* It is very obvious how much money went into this show. Costume design, casting, acting, visual effects are all spot on.
* The ""vibe"" feels very right imo. The elves, dwarves and harfoots all feel realistic yet distinct.
* I've touched on this in my first bullet, but the visuals are just amazing. Particularly the summary we get of the war against morgoth from galadriel and the intro to khazad dum. They are really stunning. As are all the locations we see. The showrunners ""get"" that they are showing elven splendor in almost all its glory and dwarves around the peak of their civilization.

The bad:

* While things feel ""tolkien"" on a micro level, they don't feel like it on a macro level. It is a bit early to say this, but the overall plot feels like the main characters move from setpiece to setpiece beause some executive made a list of ""things that should be in this show"".
* The entire ""galadriel on a boat"" story line feels really stupid to me.

Overall, watching some of these visuals made me feel like I would _love_ to see a show by these showrunners where they follow the overall plot of the silmarillion. They show they can capture the spirit and visual splendor of some of the first age, but the overall plot (as of now) feels a bit ""meh"" to me; if the tolkien estate allowed them to follow an established book I feel like we could get the best of both worlds.",14,34
2,TRUE,"To be honest, I get why they skipped the whole first age thing and made the characters we already know a bit different than what we usually would expect them to be, I'm not bothered by that too much.

There were a few things I felt made the show feel a bit cheap, like, why did Celebrimbor needs the thing ready by spring? Why say it's urgent without giving a reason? I didn't like how it felt like him and Elrond got to Khazad-Dum by taking a nice stroll - they got there without any equipment or horses, while wearing the same clothes, and all it took was showing the location on the map. I didn't like that challenge Elrond had to do with the dwarves, felt like a lot of filler with no actual risk or results. I didn't love how Durin was so offended by not being visited by Elrond - he had 20 years to visit his friend or send a letter or something, if it was so important to him. I didn't like how it felt like a lot was happening so they had to skip a lot of traveling (Galadriel was all the way up north, then back in town, then basically all the way to Valinor) while it didn't feel like too much has happened, really.

Also, I don't want to complain about canon stuff because it's pointless, but the whole Valinor thing with Galadriel - being chosen to go, going and then jumping ship at the last second - I just didn't like it, felt dramatic for drama's sake.",14,35
2,TRUE,The first two episodes are amazing. I loved the score and the intro for episode 2.,14,36
2,TRUE,"On re-watch of episode one, it occurred to me that Galadriel's swan ship was a nod to her Telerin heritage. And the other (presumably Noldor) children destroying it a nod to the first kinslaying and/or the burning of their ships.",13,37
2,TRUE,"I’m of mixed mind on this so far. 

As a TV show, taken without the source material, it’s gorgeous, well acted, and I like many of the characters. The hobbit girls are great, I like the actress whose playing Galadriel, and the dwarves are super fun. They are doing a few intriguing things with the story too. 

But…

This thing is really playing fast and loose with the lore:

- Gil Galad had no ability to lift then ban of the Valar placed on Galadriel. She only was granted this after passing her great test (refusing to take the ring). And the ocean stuff is just silly. There were better ways to handle that. If she sailed west from Lindon to Valinor, how the hell did she end up south of Gondor? That’s white the swim. 

- What the hell is the meteor dude? 

- the elven ranger guy is pretty dull so far. Hope he’s not a main character, or that he develops more of a personality. 

- The elf casting is uneven. Galadriel is pretty good, but some of the rangers, and Gil Galad are a bit stiff so far. I was expecting a bit more majesty and unearthly wisdom from the high king of the elves. 

- Not sold on Elrond yet. But it’s early days. 

I like it. It’s better than the hobbit movies. But I’m not expecting it to be super accurate to the lore so far. Which is unfortunate. Tolkien was a much better world builder than the people at Amazon. 

But that said… it’s a good, well paced show if taken on that merits. Better than I was expecting. 

I can forgive some wandering off canon if it is done well. Time will tell.",14,38
2,TRUE,"I was able to overlook a lot of things, but it was hard to overlook the characterizations of the elves. Galadrial was said to be one of the most powerful elves, second- or even rivaling Feanor. I just don't get that vibe. Even though Gil-Galad is the high king, it's difficult to believe he would treat her with so much disrespect. Also, where's Celeborn? They also suggest that Elrond is looked down upon because he is half-elven, but this is crazy. His parents are literally flying in a boat in the sky.

Lastly, there was said to be great friendship between the noldor and Durin's folk. Shouldn't Celebrimbor already know the dwarves? And shouldn't the door be a lot bigger and look like the picture in FOTR? That's a small for so many Dwarves to get in and out.",14,39
2,TRUE,"My biggest issue is the complete miss on how elves in Tolkien behaved, thought, and how their society worked. The movies and show never do a good job telling you what a noldor or a teleri is, quenya vs sindarin. The reason galadrial is outcast is she is cursed, they took an oath to pursue morgoth for the silmarils. The reason the elves cross the helcaraxe is the light of the trees lives on in the silmarils. Galadrial is different. Galadrial comes to middle earth in the first age. She meets and married celeborn in the first age, they  That's thousands of years separated from the events of this series in the second age. Her husband distrusts dwarves because of the sack of doriath by the sons of faenor. The First Age ended with the War of Wrath and the defeat of Morgoth. Beleriand was ruined and sank beneath the Sea. Many of the Ñoldor returned to the Undying Lands with the pardon of the Valar, but Galadriel remained in Middle-earth with Celeborn. her motive is competely different in the show for some reason. Galadrial being noldor and her husband sindarin would have been cool. Their daughter married elrond eventually. I just don't see how the series will accomplish any of these bits. Like they met and married in the first age, and celebrian was born early second age, shortly after the founding of Numenor, which makes her and elrond of an age give or take a century or two, and galadrial is significantly older than elrond, and is eventually his mother in law. So by this time they would be related and the relationship would be a mother in law son in law relationship. The show doesn't capture these beats very well.",13,40

2,TRUE,"I watched this with a lot of expectation - and worry. There are things I liked, mostly the visual style, the cinematography and the sets, especially Kazad-Dum. To see Kazad Dum in it's glory was a feast.

But overall the first two episodes were a disappointment. What I loved about Tolkien's work, specifically LOTR, and what made me reread his books again, and again (and again and again and again) since childhood was the sense of honor that existed in his world. Characters grappled with decisions based on a sense of duty for the whole, and a recognition that they would pay a price for doing their duty. Be it Frodo, Aragorn or Galadriel - 'this task has been thrust on you, will you heed it's call' is a motive that comes up again and again. Following this path of duty, of giving of yourself for the greater good, was seen as positive, grappling with the call to duty was depicted with understanding, and, to me, above all else this is what made the world so grand, beautiful and poetic.

And, above all other details I dislike, this is what makes RoP a failure to me. The universal sense of honor is missing. Galadriel is an angry, compulsive, obsessed character, who is trying to take down Sauron for revenge. Elrond has been reduced to a political manipulator. Gil-Galad -  seemed to  send Galadriel away to get rid of her, almost threatened by her insubordinance. (What was with these borderline authoritarian, imperialistic elves, anyway?).

I didn't like the casting of the elves, which looked like humans with pointy ears (and why do some elves look old, how does Celebrimbor look so much older than Galadriel?) and the rigid depiction of elvish society, I thought the hobbits were a little too 'aw chucks, my lad', I was constantly wondering what had happened to Celeborn, I felt the balance of action/humor/depth was off - but most of all I miss a world in which characters strive to do right, guided by something more than their own flawed selfs.

I fully believe the writers think they have created this world, as the opening dialogue between Galadriel and Finrod about darkness and light indicates - but, for me, they haven't. Just like they open the whole series with a quite lovely description of the years of the trees - and immediately show petty elven kids cruelly destroying a work of beauty, apparently not even noticing how they are contradicting what Galadriel's voice over was trying to describe. Maybe they just can't help themselves seeing (and thus creating) a world from our current human point of view?",12,42
2,TRUE,"Making this a top level for separate discussion, but I am pretty sure ""The Stranger"" is either Saurman or one of the Blue Wizards. 

I pulled the following two excepts from my copy of Peoples of Middle-earth (typed from the physical copy, sorry if there are typos). 

Support for Saruman:

&gt; No names are recorded for the two wizards. They were never seen or known in the lands west of Mordor. The wizards did not come at the same time. Possibly Saruman, Gandalf, Radagast did, but more likely Saruman the chief (and already over mindful of this) came first and alone.

Ane the Blue Wizards:

&gt; The 'other two' came much earlier, at the same time probably Glorfindel, when matters became very dangerous in the Second Age. Glorfindel was sent to aid Elrond and was (though not yet said) pre-eminent to the war in Eriador. But the other two Istari were sent for a different purpose. Morinehtar and Romestamo, Darkness-Slayer and East-helper. Their task was to circumvent Sauron: to bring help to the few tribes of Men that had rebelled from Melkor-worhsip, to stir up rebellion and after his first fall to search out his hiding.... They must have had very great influence on the history of the Second Age and Third Age in weakening and disarraying the forces of the East .... who would have both in the Second Age and Third Age otherwise have ... outnumbered the West.

I feel like it might be Saruman more because Rhovanion is kind of smack dab inside of Middle-earth and it was said pretty well that the Blue Wizards basically had no business in Middle-earth, but only the Eastern lands. Arondir and the human village he is in is already shown to be in those said Eastern lands so it still could be the Blue Wizards.",14,43

I don’t think we’re gonna see Annatar since I’m not sure if that name is in the appendices and there would be no twist (or it would immediately be spoiled online). Instead I think one of the new characters will be Sauron in disguise. 

My bet is on Halbrand but I’ve also seen theories that he could become the witch king",12,48

2,TRUE,"I really enjoyed the Harfoots and Dwarves because I felt like I got immersed into middle earth. Elrond is great mostly and Galadriel has her moments, however I'm increasingly getting the feeling that the elves' mannerisms are off and it's pulling me out. Somehow they seem like men with pointy ears sometimes but other times they are fine. 

Also, what was that with the troll? You would think these group of elves are highly trained fighters or almost as skilled as Galadriel. It was weird to see them easily taken down by one ice troll. What would have happened if they had found Sauron and his orcs?",13,50
3,TRUE,"I feel like the lack of Silmarillion rights really hurts the narrative more than anything else.

I don't think this show's going to pass up on young Witch King, but Halbrand is now shown to very much not be a Numenorean in this episode, which seems to rule him out for Witch King candidacy. You think young Witch King would be popping up for an adaptational early appearance, but thinking back on the major Numenorean characters shown in this episode I don't know who he could possibly be.",38,3

3,TRUE,"I thought it was okay. It's taking liberties with the source material but the references are all surprisingly accurate. Love how Galadriel names herself as ""Daughter of the Golden house of Finarfin"". In a way, that makes her related to Tar Miriel, since her line is from Idril, granddaughter of Fingolfin.

I think they might go with the interpretation that the Orcs were former Elves that Morgoth corrupted. Very interesting path.

Tar Miriel was a nice bait and switch. Initially it seemed to imply that she was willingly going along with Numenor's hatred of Elves and the Valar, but we get a nice twist that this might not be the case. Makes her character interesting and multidimensional.",42,5

Starts war and destroys the one elf kingdom where Elrond is at. Numenor shows up and fights Sauron, can’t beat them so is willingly taken prisoner and goes to Numenor and corrupts it. 
Numenor falls and world changes, Elindil creates the kingdoms in exile. Souron returns to Mordor no longer being able to take fair forms. Kingdom in exile and elf’s fight many wars with Nazgûl sarouns forces until they finally go to Mordor cit the ring and start third age.

3,TRUE,"Notes

* Fuck I was not expecting all of the watchtower elves to be enslaved
* All of these scenes with the orcs were great, loved the tension in the water scene
* Numinor looks great, very Atlantean/Byzantine
* Elendil and Isildur being here is one thing im still iffy on. I get time compression but this seems a bit too much. I would have had them show up in S3 or 4 after a time skip of a century or so
* This is softened though because I love the casting of the two, especially Elendil. I believe this man is Aragorn’s ancestor. If I have to guess, when Numinous falls, Elendil will be the person who leads them to Middle Earth and is the founder of Gondor
* Pretty certain Adar is not Sauron. I think he is just an elf who fell to the dark
* Another complaint, it didn’t bother me as much in the first two eps, but I do think they are over using the slow mo and dramatic pauses a bit
* I dont think Halbrand is Sauron (honestly I dont think any of these mystery people are going to turn out to be). While im leaning towards him becoming a Ringwraith, i love the idea that he is the King of the Mountains, the ghost king cursed for not aiding Elendil
* I dont know how much of a putz I am but I did not see the reveal that the sigil was a map of Mordor coming. I thought it was just a stylized version of the eye of Sauron
* The hobbit stuff was interesting, I liked the eulogy scene
* Ok im fully behind the Stranger being a wizard now. Still hoping for a Blue over Gandalf
* I liked the warg, the slightly different smaller look was fine, this isn’t a warg bred for riding

In all I liked this ep, less than Ep 2 but a bit more than Ep 1. While I like Galadriel herself, her storyline at the moment is the weakest one for me",33,8
3,TRUE,"No mention of Ulmo. Ulmo could have been talking to Isildur... he could have given a vision to Galadriel which is why she is left the ship going to Valinor. So much could be explained if they just used Ulmo as the whisper, the vision, the truth coming from the sea...
Also, I like the deep voice of the actor for Elendil. But Elendil is Elendil the tall. Would have been nice to see him towering over everyone at the royal court. He commands presence as the leader of the Faithful.

Halbrand should not be taller than the ordinary Numenorian. The showrunners are missing the little bits of lore that would make this more spectacular...",33,9
3,TRUE,"When it comes to Halbrand, I don’t see him coming out as a good guy or even a king-turned-Nazgûl. The show put some heavy emphasis on him doing two rather twisted things: letting those people on the boat die and then when he goes semi-feral when he is attacked in Numenor and ends up savagely snapping that guy’s arm. It would seem strange for the show to overlook these two things, follow an arc where he becomes a king in the southlands, and THEN turns Nazgûl under Sauron’s influence. I think they have already set him up as too cruel out the gate. Which leads me to believe the Sauron theory a little more. 

While it’s not a popular theory I think it can be really good if done properly. They should show no more scenes of Halbrand doing anything overtly evil. Let him maintain his current level of charm and smooth talking, make the character as likable as possible. I know some think it would be a cliche plot twist for Halbrand to turn evil but at this rate, I think people are going to end up really liking this character. I think it’s poetic that Halbrand could also charm us (the viewers) and then betray us and truly be Sauron. 

I also think this mystery is one of the best things the show has going for it. Sauron disguising himself as a good guy is canonical, and it keeps me really interested in watching new episodes to gather more clues.",32,10
3,TRUE,"I like this new backstory for Mordor, it makes it much more tragic and deepens the degree to which Sauron scars Middle-Earth, as well as Middle-Earth's greater lore. Mordor being mostly just an evil place was always much weaker than the rest of Tolkien's mythos.",28,11
3,TRUE,"I enjoyed it, but something was off. Please bear in mind it's been some time since I read the books for the last time. 

- Some scenes/actors feel awkward indeed, specially the Galadriel/Elendil/Queen/Isildur part. I enjoy Galadriel being angryish and serious, as she's suffered so much trauma and is still developing her character, but some actions of hers just don't make much sense regarding the environment. Why would she try to flee at daytime? And threaten Elendil in the middle of the city for nothing?

- Halbrand. Where did he get the money? Why would he try to steal the emblem of the guild instead of negotiating a way to participate in it? His pretending wouldn't last long anyway. And Elendil's sister? Everything here felt so rushed.

- The Harfoots saying that no one is left behind, Nori's father saying no Harfoot was ever left behind (EDIT: he said Brandyfoot specifically, thanks for pointing that out), just for the leader to read aloud a lengthy list of the people who fell along the way (or maybe I got it wrong and it was just about people who died?). And they talking about being decaravaned as the ultimate punishment, so it happened sometime, even though must've been an extremely rare occasion. I get they're trying to build up all these cultures and their values in a very short time span so sometimes things may feel contradictory if one is not paying attention. And I love the fact that each people has its own idioms about things that are central for their way of life, but if I can't hear them talking about wheels any longer. Still I love the Harfoots, I love Nori and the Stranger, and it's one of my favourite arcs so far. I remain believing he's Olorin for many reasons but I won't be extending the subject.

- The part in which Galadriel visits Halbrand in the cells gave me instant panic as it reminded me of that scene in the Hobbit movies. Fortunately it was much better of course.

I am enjoying it enormously, it's gorgeous, and it's a world which I practically grew up in. I love the new things they are adding, it makes everything so much more interesting. I choose to welcome the creative decisions mostly, since in the era of Internet we are used to instantly criticise absolutely everything, always trying to point out how we ourselves would make it better to our particular taste. So I try not to nitpick everything, but some things are still leaving a bad aftertaste to me.",29,12
3,TRUE,Guessing Ar-Pharazôn is the queen’s uncle. And something terrible is going to happen to the queen,29,13
3,TRUE,"Thoughts on episode 3:

(Episode [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/x3qfr2/z/imxwnsk), [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/x3qfr2/z/imt9yy8))

* Writers were Cahill and Doble

* We have a few Orc names here - as spelled in the subtitles, I counted Lurka, Vrath, and Magrot. ""Vrath"" stood out to me due to the unusual consonant cluster \&lt;vr\&gt;, which I don't think is attested in the very limited amount of Orcish or Black Speech Tolkien gave us. But it's a very small corpus.

* Elendil's acting struck me as very wooden in his first few lines on the ship, but it got much better as the episode went on and I grew to enjoy his performance. He's not very tall (looks like Halbrand is a little taller), but then again neither is Galadriel on the show. From Pharazôn's description of Elendil it seems as if his ancestry has been diminished in nobility as well as his stature, but perhaps there's more than meets the eye here?

* I like the design of Númenor a lot. I particularly liked the giant stone faces seen as the ship was sailing in (although they reminded me a bit of driving into Legoland with its driveway studded with giant Lego figures). But the architecture, costumes, everything really conveyed the wealth and power - and pride - I've always associated with late Númenorean culture.

* Some of the violence was surprisingly graphic - the broken arm and splatter of blood on the screen. Still a far cry from, say, *Game of Thrones* level violence but more than I expected. Not a criticism, I was just surprised.

* The ""left...right"" gag with Nori and Poppy was kind of odd. I'm all for humor on the show, especially with the Hobb..er, Harfoots, but this joke just didn't land for me and I think it went on a bit too long.

* The opening to Sadoc's ""Most agreeable, honourable Harfoots"" speech really recalled Bilbo's birthday speech for me. It was a nice touch without being a direct quote.

* Some of the Harfoot names read by Sadoc were modern names of Latin (""Miles"") or French (""Chance"") origin. These were slightly jarring for me as when Tolkien didn't use botanical names for Hobbits he usually preferred Germanic (Samwise, Frodo, Smeagol, Deagol) or native Brythonic names (Meriadoc), although there are exceptions (e.g. Peregrin). I was reminded of Radagast calling a hedgehog ""Sebastian"" in the Hobbit movies, which also sounded wrong to my ears. When Tolkien did use French-inflected names they tended to be much older/Norman French (e.g. Fortinbras) compared to a name like Chance which is still in use.

* More highly acrobatic fighting. Again a stylistic choice but not one I'm a fan of. I didn't think the CGI on the warg was as bad as some people seem to, but it was definitely more ""TV grade"" than cinematic. But why can't wargs just be big demonic wolves??

* It doesn't really make sense for Arondir to use Quenya, as others have noted.

One thread I feel is emerging is that the language of the show is not quite what I hoped for. There's a Silvan elf speaking Quenya, there were Dwarves using their own house name for a rock-splitting contest, there's a Harfoot named after a flower that should probably only exist in Tol Eressëa and Númenor at this point, there are other Harfoots with names that don't quite sound Tolkienish, and even in English there's the uneven dialogue. 

N.B. that none of these things are exactly *wrong*. They're just maybe *not done as well as they could be*. Many of these things on their own are nitpicks, but taken together I do think there's a bit of a pattern that they aren't being quite as thoughtful with linguistics as they could. And for  a Tolkien show that's a problem, to me at least. I get it, writing a TV show is hard, but I hold the bar for language higher for this show than I would an original IP or a Game of Thrones show.

All in all I liked (most) of the Númenor stuff in this episode. The Arondir plotline was decent. The Harfoots didn't especially grab me. I'm increasingly confident that the Stranger is Olorin. But we'll see!",27,14
3,TRUE,"Why do most of the characters in this episode feel so angry without any good setup as to why? Also why do they keep setting up new ""mysteries"" every episode?",23,15
3,TRUE,"This may be unpopular, but overall I thought episode 3 was much better than episode 1 and 2. It shows where Amazon went wrong, but also where they do well.

We saw Numenor and all of its splendor. The entire Numenor sequence was great; my only complaint is that I wish we saw Anarion instead of an original character. Anarion is who Aragorn is descended from, and I wish he was there. But overall, it echoes the other thing that Amazon did well, which is Khazad-dum.

The dwarves story was wonderful and I think we all liked seeing Moria at its height. And having heard so much about Durin, exploring his story with Disa was great. But they didn’t spend nearly enough time on the dwarves.

HOWEVER, they did still fuck up elves backstory and properly giving some kind of explanation on the war of the jewels. I know that they can’t mention the Silmarillion, but the writing wasn’t great with the elves. Little time was spent on any of the elves and explaining their backstory.

What they should have done with is… 
Episode 1: focus on introducing the elves and the war of the jewels.
Episode 2: focus on the dwarves backstory and the dwarves and elves relationship.
Episode 3: exactly what they did and introduce Numenor.
Episode 4: idk what they will do but here they can introduce the other Men of middle earth. 
And they can sprinkle in some of the Harfoots stories, though I think less time should be spent on them.

What they did poorly in the first two episodes was the pacing and the amount of detail they’re explaining about the elves, the war with Morgoth, and showing too little of what they did well, which is the dwarves.

If they wrote episode 1 and 2 how they did episode 3, then I think the show would have been a lot better received. Because lore inaccuracies aside, idk how anyone looks at episode 1 and 2 and think that it was good writing or pacing",23,16
3,TRUE,"I liked it!

I see a lot of people coming up with reasons why the way Galadriel act doesn't make sense. Of course she's not going to act the way she acted in the book, we're thousands of years before the book takes place. She's thousand of years old, she should be wiser? Realistically that's probably right, but static characters with no progression or growth only make for interesting stories when those stories are structured in very particular ways (see: Aragorn in LOTR). I'd agree that she comes off as more petulant than proud, but I'm going to give the writers the benefit of the doubt for now and see where they take her character.

I have a timeline question, the presence of Isildur has me very, very confused. My understanding is that this show takes place in the middle of the Second Age, around the year 1500, right around the time Sauron forged the rings (according to LOTR Appendix B). But now we have Elendil and Isildur showing up, who only show up in the book chronology ~1600 years later. Apologies if this was a given for anybody going into this show, I try to avoid anything other than shows/movies themselves, but am I correct in saying that this show is compressing the [War Of The Elves And Sauron](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/War_of_the_Elves_and_Sauron) and the [War Of The Last Alliance](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/War_of_the_Last_Alliance) into a single event?",22,17
3,TRUE,"I actually liked this episode more than the first two, mostly because of Numenor, although I'm still really not sold on the show at all. 

\- Their portrayal of Numenor seems Jackson-influenced: the first 4 notes of the theme for Numenor sound similar to Howard Shore's music for the Argonath scene. 

\- Numenor should be a colonial power by this point. 

\- there were a few touches I liked - the elves refusing to chop down the tree, Arondir's almost-Túrin moment, Galadriel contemplating stealing a ship. 

\- I also like the fact that Anarion will be in this adaptation. 

\- They've turned the Lords of Andúnië into minor nobility who are essentially 'working class'. I don't mind Elendil so far, but I don't really love Isildur as a callow young man known to his mates as 'Isil'. It'll take some doing to sell him as the man that he becomes, or should become. 

\- I was very surprised by the direction they took with Tar-Miriel: I think she will probably turn out to be a secret Eldar-sympathiser, and fears the Elves' arrival because of the conflict it will cause in Numenor, not because she fears the Elves. 

\- Pharazon is very disappointing so far. He seems like a bog-standard sleazy vizier. Much like Isildur, it'll be hard to buy him becoming Ar-Pharazon the Golden, conqueror of Sauron. 

\- the horse shot was - just odd? Galadriel's odd smile and the horse being quite ugly really didn't help. It reminded me of Neidermeyer's horse in Animal House. 

\- I really don't buy the idea that Sauron was planning to settle in Mordor since the first age. I'm not entirely sure that I buy the idea that he was contingency planning for Morgoth's defeat either, although I find that easier to accept. 

\- the orcs look really good, and I like the fact that they make a bigger deal of the sunlight thing than Peter Jackson did - although, while the orcs hate sunlight, it shouldn't actually burn their flesh. The warg, on the other hand, looks much too - cute? 

\- the fight scenes are really just awful. Jackson slipped into excess at times, like Legolas' shield-surfing and arrow-climbing, but his elves just looked like well-trained soldiers, not superheroes doing 360-degree mid-air flips or video game characters executing combos. 

\- Arondir's band are Noldor?? I assumed that they were Sindar, but they refer to the 'High King', and Arondir speaks Quenya. 

\- I am moderately convinced that Halbrand will become a Nazgul. 

\- Meteor man is going to be Gandalf, isn't he? That would be extremely disappointing, if so. 

\- I think Adar is unlikely to be Sauron. I hope the leaks about him being a corrupted first-age elf are untrue. If so, I at least hope he's an original character for the show - if he's a named major character from the Silmarillion, we'd be getting into 'unwatchable' territory.",22,18

\-I'm warming up to the Harfoots (I like their ""tough shit if you get left behind"" culture, feels very realistic), while i'm cooling off on Galadriel. She doesn't seem wise enough.

3,TRUE,"Still trying to determine what bits in this series the Tolkien Estate allowed the show runners to ""borrow"" from the Silmarillion, and I think Numenor on the map might be one of them.

Minor thing, but feels like evidence they're actually allowed to take from other sources, at least a little.",18,21
3,TRUE,"* Numenor looks amazing. It really seems like an advanced human society. The politics seems promising enough.

Theo is short for Theoden, which means king. He is named for his father who was a king or at least had royal blood. He will be a Nazgûl.

Halbrand, also a king of men, will be a Nazgûl.

Adar is a corrupted elf, lieutenant of Sauron, not Sauron.",15,24
3,TRUE,"Galadriel is a powerful sorceress. Arwen also says his father Elrond has the gift of foresight (which she also appears to inherit). 

&amp;#x200B;

Wonder when we will see these traits in the show. Galadriel is more of a headstrong warrior. Elrond a rational nerd/wordsmith (and would-be smith of other things).",17,25
3,TRUE,Who do we think adar is? Almost looked elvish.,14,26
3,TRUE,"I am continually impressed by this series, while I don't agree with every decision made I think that any concerns I had have been allayed with the strong start these episodes have made. My only slight concern currently is that given how they were talking about him Anarion appears to have been made the older brother, however this is an extremely minor change and I can see possible ways they might use it in the future of the show.

&amp;#x200B;

My current theories are:

Adar is Sauron, I think the term father is being used in the same way someone may refer to a deity. We know that Sauron did not allow the Orcs to use that name. This twitter thread is also a part of my reasoning: [https://twitter.com/crash22crash/status/1560396455373934594](https://twitter.com/crash22crash/status/1560396455373934594)

Halbrand will likely lead the people of the Southlands away following a battle between Sauron's forces and the Numenoreans led by Miriel and Galadriel (we have seen clips of this already). I think this will likely result in a pyrrhic victory with Sauron gaining control of Mordor and constructing Barad Dur. Halbrand's people will become the Eotheod and he may even be an ancestor of Eorl.

Following this battle, Sauron will have a significantly weaker force and will set Mordor up as a strong Defensive position for his forces and this is when he will go forth as Annatar (though he may need to be given a different name as I think this name isn't used in LotR or the appendices). 

While this battle is going on Pharazon will usurp the throne and upon her return Miriel will be forced to marry him. This may even involve Pharazon assassinating Tar-Palantir.

The stranger is interesting, given the Harfoots are presumably moving north from Rhovanion towards the Misty mountains and the Anduin (I think the mountain pass mentioned may be the Emyn Muil)

This final points are more hopes than solid theories:

I hope we get to meet Celeborn and Celebrian at some point during the show, I like to think that reconnecting with her family (whom shell will not have seen for centuries on her quest to find Sauron) will prove a strong plot point in Galadriel's character arc within the show.

I also hope Elendil will show the Ring of Barahir to Galadriel, this would be another powerful character moment between these two given it, like her dagger has a direct connection to her brother.",14,27
3,TRUE,"The dialogue ruined a lot of it for me, specifically in the Numenor plot. Halbrand sounds way too modern in his speech, and Galadriel's too, in many parts. 

Also: why do people think that the Noldor can pass for human if they hide their ears? Where in Tolkien does it say that?",15,28
3,TRUE,The little Nori Brandyfoot actress is absolutely knocking it out of the park every episode and stealing the whole show imo,14,29

3,TRUE,The stranger’s constellation looks so much like Gandalfs G-Rune...and even more fire stuff this ep. I’d rather him be Saruman or a blue but it’s all but confirmed I think.,13,31
3,TRUE,"I didn't like the direction it's going. Elves should be almost Angelic and Galadriel being told what to do by some random guy (elbrand?) as if he's more aware of politics than an over thousand year elf.

However. It might also be genius if it turns out that he's Sauron and the guy showed at the end of the episode is a bait and switch.

Sauron was a master of deception and in the books it says he was captured by Numenoreans and then leading to the downfall. So Galadriel listening to him might not be a sign of her being stupid but recognising someone who speaks intelligently.

If it turns out that the guy at the end actually is the real Sauron then this show is pretty basic and run of the mill and I don't have much hope.

It doesn't have to be MY fan theory as the person who people assume is Gandalf might also be Sauron and being deceptive is also a fun bait and switch.

I did actually prefer how elves were shown in the prison camp, that they were acrobatic and athletic to show their experience. I thought the guy getting his throat slit having a sad scene was a bit dumb from a cinematic perspective as the audience barely knew him so it had no impact. The guy getting shot with arrows did deserve one though. His death also being symbolic of cutting off their hope.

 I think it would have also been cooler if it was clear that the arrows came from a different prison camp giving the scope that their camp is actually one of hundreds.",13,32

3,TRUE,"Do we think that Galadriel by now would understand that Finrod is alive and well in Aman? By the time she left, no elf who had seen the Trees had yet died and been reborn AFAIK. So would the fate of dead Elves really be understood, or is there any way word would have reached Middle Earth when Finrod became the first of them to actually emerge from the Halls of Mandos and walk again in Aman? Perhaps Elves who lived and died in  Cuiviénen before the Sundering had been reborn and joined the Calaquendi, and Finrod was just the first of the Eldar to be re-embodied, distinct from these Primitive Elves whose re-embodiment would be their first entrance to Aman?",12,41

Numenor should have colonized Umbar and Future South Gondor and it is Lindon they would be isolating from in Middle Earth

Eregion should be called Hollin

Sauron has already been to Numenor as Annatar and they told him to fuck off.

There are also Dwarves in Lindon from the Blue Mountains

There are dragons, perhaps in the northeast, one named Smaug (unless they reproduce post War of Wrath)

3,TRUE,"So with numenor hating the elves already, can we assume annatar has already been corrupting them slowly?",9,43
3,TRUE,"i didn't really love ep. 1, enjoyed ep. 2, and now ep. 3 is probably my least favorite. i can't pinpoint precisely why, but i feel disconnected from the stakes of the story. Galadriel recognizing that the sigil was actually a piece of a map seemed strangely conveyed because a separate character just brought the scroll into the room, bowed, and left. then that scroll had the answers on it. i'm not saying that a lore master/librarian shouldn't be able to help, but i feel like some dialogue between Galadriel, Elendil, or the lore master could have been nice to explain what type of thing she is seeking. again, it's a small detail, but the scene just played out oddly to me. 

the other thing is that the action scene at the end became ridiculous for me, and i'm not just going to complain about Arondir flipping and spinning multiple times. to me, they already HAD an awesome action set piece: the push and pull of the chains + the tension of the elves also trying to escape. there were multiple things going on at once, and the blocking made it tense and exciting. 

most of that evaporated for me when arondir jumped into the air and cut down the canopy. I loved that the sunlight was what drove the orcs back, but by the time the warg battle was going on, i felt disconnected from what was a pretty good grounded action scene. throw in a couple more arondir flips, a CGI model that didn't seem well integrated into the scene, and it just didn't work for me at all. i could tell the CGI was a little spotty with the wyrm in the ocean, but in that case the direction did a creative thing: we could never quite see it all at once, and the ocean masked its body. in the case of the warg, i was reminded of some of the worse CGI moments in the recent IT remakes.",9,44
3,TRUE,"It's a little funny that Elendil notes that Galadriel's eyes seem similar to his children's. It makes sense on a metaphorical level, but is a little funny given that he is a descendent from her cousin, Turgon.

Why is Elros still alive? He's supposed to be mortal and died 1,000 years prior to the forging of the rings. Well, I guess it will be interesting to get his perspective of Numenorian isolation.

I really hope that they don't rush the fall of Numenor. They have seeded some of the issues leading to it's fall, but it would be interesting to see the Numenorian defence against Sauron's forces in the south and their progressive corruption and oppressive colonization of the Southlands (this would set up a very interesting conflict with Halbrand). From there, I would hope that they play into the downfall of Numenor and the temple of Morgoth, but I doubt they'll actually dig into this. The main way they could really, really mess this one up is if they just gloss over the fall of Numenor in just a few episodes.",9,45

Also not sure how I feel about the superhuman feats we've seen from Galadriel and Arondir. Granted, I've not read the books so idk if that's how Elves are portrayed but it clashes with a somewhat grounded fantasy setting. 

The orcs were great though. I love orcs. 

Idk, we'll see how the show progresses from here. Certainly keeping an open mind.",9,47

I'm just watching as a fan, trying to get lost in the world. And it's just so much fun!

4,TRUE,Galadriel remains the hardest part of this show to watch for me. The idea that all she is after thousand of years of life up to this point is zealot-soldier with no semblance of statecraft and courtly behavior is such a woeful misrepresentation of the character.

4,TRUE,"Things I liked:

\- The ending. It felt rousing to see men of Numenor pledge themselves to the cause. I liked that.

\- That shot of the orcs standing over Arondir was terrifying.

\- Durin III and IV and Disa were all great although I'm detecting more and more cracks in Disa's Scottish accent that will eventually annoy the hell out of me if they continue.

\- I liked Elrond talking about Earendil.

\- The Orcs in general. They've done a great job of making them really scary.

&amp;#x200B;

Things I didn't like:

\- The choreography of Galadriel imprisoning 4 armed and armoured Numorean guardsmen. She pushes one of the guys toward the cell, two other's just fall in with him, she grabs the next guy, it cuts to Pharazon and Halbrand for a few seconds, cuts back and she's pushing the last guard in. Those are the most incompetent guards in all of Numenor. It was lazy and unconvincing.

\- The Palantir giving visions. Maybe someone can justify that one for me. Why was it giving a vision of a possible future? Aren't the Palantiri for communicating with each other and seeing over long distances? I don't recall anything about them showing visions like the mirror of Galadriel.

\- Celebrimbor randomly spitting out that Earendil once said his fate would be in the hands of his son. Weird. Where was the need for that? It felt crowbarred in. It actually felt like a hamfisted attempt by Celebrimbor to manipulate Elrond, but there didn't seem to be any reason for it.

Galadriel acknowledging Halbrand's judgement that she doesn't know how to behave in a royal court. I just. What.

Elendil referring to himself as a petty lord. Fuck Andunie I guess.

~~Pharazon's speech to the masses. The speech itself wasn't bad, but the women who came out of nowhere with enough glasses and drinks for everyone there was just silly. There was literally no need for it and it wasn't believable. Edit the scene to remove that and it's a better scene. Just another example of the strange choices being made that take me out of scenes.~~  On second watch I was wrong about this scene. There's not anything wrong with it.

The Arondir/Bronwyn romance. Every time I see them get close in a scene, they have so little chemistry that it feels as though the characters themselves are resisting some unseen force pushing them to be together.

Arondir catching the arrow. I just didn't like it. ~~""But what about Legolas???????????"" Legolas in the Hobbit was ridiculous and bad. Legolas in LOTR was mostly fine. But the point is Legolas was Legolas. Not some random elf. I never took Legolas' feats to mean every elf can do this, the same way I never took Aragorn's feats to mean every man can do what he does. Catching an arrow is insane. Legolas did things that required incredible agility and the fleetfootedness that was described in the books. Arondir did something that requires him to be the Flash.~~  Turns out this isn't as superhuman as I thought. I saw a video of someone doing it and tbh it looks a lot better in full speed than the slow-mo the show keeps using. I think I would have like it a lot more in full speed.

The Orc hearing Theo grunt when the bucket hits him but not hearing Theo loudly emerge from the water. This is the kind of thing that happens in TV/film all the time. It's lazy. Write a better scenario, one that doesn't require you to contradict what you've just written.

4,TRUE,"My notes on episode 4:

(Episode [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/x9ngql/z/insnpfk), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/x3qfr2/z/imxwnsk), [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/x3qfr2/z/imt9yy8))

* Writers: Folsom, Payne, McKay

* Director: Yip

* Míriel's dream reminds me of Faramir's dream he recounts in ""The Steward and the King,"" which was in turn actually Tolkien's dream: ""I mean the terriblerecurrent dream (beginning with memory) of the Great Wave, towering up, and coming in ineluctably over the trees and green fields. (I bequeathed it to Faramir.)"" (Letter 163, to WH Auden). He also mentions that unbeknownst to each other one of his sons had the same dream (Letter 180 identifies the son as Michael). The movies give the dream to Éowyn, which makes little sense if it's about the downfall of Númenor, so I think the movies were trying to change the context to something more metaphorical. Boy, this dream gets around!

* It was interesting to me that the guildsman (Tamar, I think?) openly criticizes the Queen Regent, in public, in broad daylight, with no apparent consequences. It's a contrast with the Elves of Lindon, who as I noted in episode 1 talked a lot about authority and respect for the chain of command. This seems a little backwards to me. Having said that, the real purpose of the scene was clearly to demonstrate Pharazôn's skill in rallying the public to his side.

* Elendil identifies himself as ""just a petty lord"" - is he being self-effacing to hide his true heritage (I hope), or has he been genuinely lowered in status?

* I noted about 10 minutes in that this episode was still on Númenor. So they're staying with one storyline longer than they did the first couple episodes (compare the first scene of episode 2). Also, after leaving Elrond and the Dwarves out of episode 3, the Harfoots and the Stranger are absent from this episode. I think this is a good change; flitting between four separate storylines in the first two episodes made it so none of them had much room to breathe. Three are easier to keep track of.

* ""The West? The real Númenor? That garbage your brother used to spew?"" - so this implies that Anárion is Faithful. Also, is Anárion going to be older than Isildur? It's hard to imagine he could be ten years younger and yet so influential and well-known.

* We get confirmation that Adar is meant to mean father. This was widely assumed, but now we know that it's intentional.

* Judging from the overhead shot of the southlanders in the watchtower, Bronwyn has the only colorful clothes in the Southlands - it almost looked like the girl with the red dress in *Schindler's List.*

* After exploring the Harfoot names last week I decided to look at the Southlanders' names this week, and they are all over the place. Bronwyn is Welsh, Theo is usually Greek (the element in Théoden and Théodred is Old English *þeod*, with a d at the end, but maybe you could say they left it off for reasons),  Rowan is Irish, Tredwill (I think) is English - perhaps it's meant to be an archaic spelling of Tredwell, an English surname. I found a reference to a house in Hampshire called Tredwill in a novel called *Wind's End* by Herbert Asquith. The name ""Waldreg"" I'm not sure about. I'm not saying this ruins the show or something, but it's another data point for me that the writers are not as diligent linguistically as Tolkien was (of course, very few people are).

* When Elrond is eavesdropping on Dúrin he hears that the *mithril* mine is below Mirrormere - clear on the east side of the mountains! It's not clear from Tolkien's descriptions if the mines actually extended below Mirrormere, or if the Dimrill Gate was the eastern extent of them. Either way, it should be quite a journey there and back!

* *Mithril* is identified as a new ore here. It may be new to the Dwarves, but it was also found in Númenor and possibly Aman - according to Bilbo's poem ""Eärendil was a mariner"" Eärendil's ship Vingilótë was made of ""mithril and of elven-glass,"" so Elrond should probably be familiar with it.

* The episodic nature of the show really shows here, with the ""what's in the box"" mystery ending of episode 2 being resolved midway through episode 4.

* The whole scene with Kemen and Eärien bumping into each other and setting up a date was straight out of a romantic comedy.

* I haven't complained at all about Galadriel's characterization, but the scene in the jail was...a little much. Halbrand genuinely seemed (at least in the moment) wiser and more intelligent than Galadriel, and that just didn't feel quite right.

* Even though Númenor is well into its decline, I had always imagined Tar-Palantir at least to voluntarily give up his life in the manner of the earlier kings of Númenor and the lords of Andúnië, rather than fall into a slow sickness and decline as he does on the show. I know that he became filled with sorrow and spent his time in the west of Númenor trying to see Avallónë, but that's a far cry from lying obtunded on a bed. I don't think Tolkien wrote about his death explicitly either way, so this is a case of my imagination being different from the writers'.

* Others have pointed out that the *palantíri* are not supposed to see the future, and I agree with that. I think they are blending them with the Mirror of Galadriel. Galadriel says here, ""*Palantíri* show many visions - some that will never come to pass."" Compare what she tells Sam: ""Remember that the Mirror shows many things, and not all have yet come to pass. Some never come to be."" It's a weird connection to make, but I think it's intentional.

* Why are the other six *palantíri* lost or hidden? Sometimes it feels like every little thing on this show is a secret waiting to be revealed.

* The voices of dwarf kings come to their heirs - this seems to be the show's (very different) version of reincarnation. Notably it sounds like it applies to *all* dwarf kings, not just the Dúrins.

* The deportation of Galadriel from Númenor is followed by a quick reversal and now Míriel herself is leading a company to Middle-earth in support of her. This felt very abrupt to me - it's another one of those TV/movie things (the PJ movies did this *a lot*) where they increase the tension and then resolve it almost immediately. We don't get any sense of time passing from the leaves falling to Míriel announcing she's going with Galadriel, no debate or questioning. It all happens very fast.

On the plus side, the dialogue generally seems to flow better than the first couple episodes did in my view, and I liked staying with each storyline for longer periods.",36,9

4,TRUE,"The more I watch TV Galadriel and ponder at where her character is going, the more I think that Amazon is trying to fit in the character development of FA Galadriel *and* SA Galadriel all into this TV, SA Galadriel.

The arrogance and immaturity and eagerness to fight first, think later is just so baffling that there’s no other reasonable explanation I can come up with. It’s not possible that they looked at lore Galadriel compared to TV Galadriel and said “yeup, this looks about right”. 

Did Amazon ever mention that they are trying to redo her entire backstory so that the Galadriel we see on TV should reflect the more “arrogant” Galadriel that left Valinor with Fingolfin? If they didn’t, they should because Galadriel not understanding the ways of court made me roll my eyes so goddamn hard",28,11
4,TRUE,"I enjoyed the scenes between Elrond and the Dwarves, but doesn't it irritate anyone else that a lot of the narrative thrust there was basically the same as in episode 2? Elrond and Durin had to mend their friendship once more, but that friendship ought to have been firmly reestablished already.

Galadriel continues to be a disappointment. She clearly is a completely different character than in the books, but even looking at the show itself her immaturity and complete lack of self-control beggar belief given her age. Maturity and age don't equate, but they do correlate. The frustrating part is that the show knows how rude and ineffectual she behaves - she gets herself imprisoned and everyone from Elendil, Halbrand to Miriel talks back to her. Yet she still does not change, and in fact she is ultimately rewarded. I do not understand why the writers believe such a character to be engaging for anyone from book fans to a general audience.

Pacing overall is rather slow still, except possibly for Númenor. Little happened in Eregion/Khazad-Dum and we still do not really know who Adar is. Seems unclear why the villager being a Sauron loyalist matters.

We got rather nice action scenes with Arondir, but I'd have traded them (and Theo hiding in a well) for more actual plot/character progression.

I have zero interest in Eariens romance at this point. Isildurs woes are slightly more engaging because there's at least some mystery to look forward to given his desire to follow Anarion.

It is unclear why the prejudiced Númenoreans would suddenly volunteer in great numbers for an expedition to Middle-Earth. The shows explanation for their prejudice is weak as well, fear of Elvish immigrants ""taking Númenorean jobs"" is highly unbelievable. They should have emphasised their jealousy of immortality more.",29,12
4,TRUE,"So in show canon the valar did still intervene in the war of wrath. Episode one implied the elves beat Morgoth on their own.

4,TRUE,Anyone catch Narsil in the room with the Palantir?,24,14
4,TRUE,"Guessed this last week and stunningly obvious from the preview of next week. The pacing was way to fast at the end and why would the proud Numenoreans not somehow punish Galadriel and Halbrand? Halbrand getting out too makes no sense at all. Why would the proud Numenoreans decide to suddenly back him after he beat up a bunch of citizens, crest or no crest? He’s just from some crushed “low man” kingdom. 

From my comment last week: Yep, my guess is Tar-Palantir foresees that this sets in motion the events that lead to Numenor’s destruction. In some later season, convinced by Sauron after imprisoning him, Al-Pharazon will use the elves weakness and Numenor’s success in the war against Sauron as evidence humans are equal to if not superior to elves and deserve eternal life too.

Note the queen is also an elf-friend, somewhat secretly, and gives Elendil a very special sword. The gift is a coded message that she is on the faithful’s side, and they will rewrite things a little to say this sword has always been with the house of Elros (Numenor’s founder) as Tolkien didn’t provide a clear provenance. Narsil isn’t supposed to be Elros’ sword (he had one called something else made by the elves) but they will rewrite to make Narsil Elros’ sword. It would make total sense though the ring of Barahir already gives us Aragorn’s physical connection to the First Age. Indeed it makes so much sense to me I think Tolkien would have made this revision eventually.

4,TRUE,"The Numenoreans somehow already lost most of the palantiri...like what the hell? Elendil is suppose to take them to Middle-earth first...

Also palantiri can show the future now. That isn't how they are supposed to work.",21,16
4,TRUE,"My theory is that Adar is Maeglin. Yes Maeglin was killed in Canon when he lost his dual with Tuor on the walls of Gondolin but I quite like the idea. 

His death seemed pretty final but explains the burn to his face falling from the walls, striking the mountain three times and falling into the flames.

It would be interesting and as his first act was sending a message, maybe he becomes the mouth of Sauron some day?

What do people think?",21,17
4,TRUE,"I enjoyed much of the episode, Adar's conversation with Arondir in particular. Makes me wonder what Arondir's full backstory is. He may have been one of the Green-elves which fled to Doriath after the death of Denethor in the first battle. Then after the ruin of Doriath he flees to the Havens of Sirion (99% certain that this is what Adar refers to and he seems to imply they both spent time there).

Other parts of the episode I liked:
Khazad-Dum was again fantastic and Elrond and Durin IV's relationship is wonderfully done. I also appreciated that Durin III was shown to be both a good king and father. Mithril seemingly being a completely new discovery is a departure from the lore but not one that has any significant impact on the story.

The Southlands, has definitely got more interesting, what will the ultimate fate of that hilt be and why does Adar want it so much? Definitely going to be some betrayal of Bronwyn and Arondir going on. One thing I really like about this plot is how they have woven the ideas of hate breeding hate into it, the Southlanders have grown to resent and hate the elves because the elves have for generations treated them with contempt and mistrust due to the deeds of their ancestors. Has an interesting parallel with some Twitter discussions that were happening this week.

I like how they are trying the mystery of the stranger into Sauron's plans but as I do not think the stranger is Sauron I wonder how he could have known that this would occur as a precursor to his plans in the Southlands. This may be answered well but I am slightly nervous that they won't address this.

Numenor continues to be fantastic the slightly goofy idea of Elves taking their jobs aside (though I can see how a common worker might be more concerned about this than about immortality). Unlike many I quite like Galadriel's lack of statecraft, fits in with the show's version of her character and was an opportunity to add some character growth towards what she will become.",21,18
4,TRUE,"Am I the only one who is dreadfully bored whenever anyone that's not Elrond or Arondir is on screen?

The worst offenders are the Harfoots (I still maintain they should never have put them in to begin with) and whenever random Numenoreans are talking on screen. Every time Elrond is chatting with Durin or the Celebrimbor it's actually pretty fun. He's a charismatic fellow.",22,19
4,TRUE,Advising Ar-Pharazôn in fair form ✅,19,20
4,TRUE,"Does anyone find Bronwyn's costume design a bit... Odd?  It just stands out like a sore thumb,  everyone else in muddy rags and she's in strappy tops and a skirt?

Not complaining too much as she's a very attractive woman but the costume still seems odd to me.",19,21
4,TRUE,I got the sense that Celebrimbor is manipulating Elrond and that's why his little story seemed so out of place and forced. He brought it up deliberately to push Elrond in to something.,18,22
4,TRUE,"Am I being dumb now or could the Mithril mining gone wrong be related to Gandalf speaking about the dwarves mining too deep and releasing the Balrog known as Durin's Bane? Was that obvious or am I just thinking too much? 

I'm also still super curious about Adar. Arondir mentioned Adar is just ""another name for Sauron"", do we believe Adar is Sauron? Do we believe that he's also Celebrimbor's mysterious friend, and will this friend be Annatar? Will we see a very pretty version or Adar in a different part of middle earth, learning the rings craft? 

I'm so invested in this, but i gotta admit I agree with what a lot of you are saying, the pacing is a little off and I'm very tired of Galadriel. (Never in my life thought I'd utter those words.)

What are your thoughts about Theo? I've been playing with the fact that he is Halbrand's son and thus have the blood of the blood pact with Morgoth running in his veins, and I've been considering if he could be the Witch-King of Angmar. Him, or Halbrand himself.

As for the villager talking about Sauron and the meteor, he didn't mention anything about the meteor BEING Sauron, just related to his return, so to me that strengthen the likelihood of the Stranger being Alatar or Pallando, and that there might've actually been two meteors and he is looking for the other. 
Saw someone mention the stars he's looking for looks like the Gemini (twins) constellation and i think that even though Alatar and Pallando aren't talked about very much, they're told to be very close friends as only Alatar was sent to middle earth and asked Pallando to join him on his quest.

Also can we PLEASE just get to see Arondir smile, just one fvcking time? Give my man some happiness...",19,23
4,TRUE,"I was thinking. Could it be, that Adar and Sauron aren't on the same side, at least not yet? I don't think it's all that clear in the books when exactly Sauron assumes Morgoth's title of dark lord. Could it be that Sauron only properly takes over all the evil forces when he forges the rings. It could be something for a show like this to explore, a power struggle between Morgoth's lieutenants. I remember Galadriel read that message in Numenor, it said the ""successor"", it didn't explicitly say Sauron, which made me think it could be deliberate.",18,24
4,TRUE,"* So, it seems like that the old man confirms to Theo that the comet was related to Sauron's return. Not sure if this means that the ""Stranger"" is Sauron or that he just arrives in parallel to Sauron coming back. Also interesting, he seems to imply some sort of prophecy passed down by the men who served Morgoth that Sauron will return. It makes the hilt Theo has been carrying around seem like a pale copy of the One Ring from the original trilogy.
* If Isildur wanted to resign, why not just do it on shore, instead of pulling a stunt on a moving ship? Seems foolish.
* Not sure why Galadriel is continuing to act in a childish way, time and time again. Why does she need Halbrand to tell her to act with a little more finesse.
* The White Tree (Nimloth) should not have any petals left after that ""snowfall"" al over the city 🤔
* Catching an arrow midair is always cool.😎
* So this ""Adar"" or ""Father"", what is he? A grumpy Elf? Sauron?
* I liked the Dwarven singing scene.
* Durin has a great dad.
* Is there anything in the books about Mithril being extra dangerous to mine? All I remember is that it's very rare
* Why keep the King's health secret if he was very unpopular anyway, due to his Elven sympathies? I mean, they put his daughter in charge instead of him.
* How many people know of the Palantir's vision? Are the Elves dislike because of it, or is it something else? 
* The ""Elves coming for our jobs"" is just putting real world politics in place where it wouldn't make sense. Why would they come for low wages in Numenor. It's not like the Elven realms are poor and destitute countries, they don't need to ""steal men's jobs"".",15,25
4,TRUE,"Very interesting chapter.  However my main concern is that action scenes have been underwhelming at best (except the prologue) and incredibly bad and cringe at worst.

Galadriel could have escaped in many cool ways, or even just convincing Pharazon I dont know, but doing karate against 5 armoured man (...ok?) And throwing ALL OF THEM into the cell felt like a cartoon.

Arondir/Theo escape started with the tipically bad last-second save but then it was well filmed and ended with a beautiful shot.",16,26
4,TRUE,"Anyone else think they should have given Galadriel's narrative to Elrond, and vice versa? It would have been quite something to see Elrond exploring his brother's kingdom, millennia after his death. Imagine the potential for character development there: Elrond reconnecting with his origins, reflecting on the loss of his mother, father, adoptive father and brother very early (in elf terms) in his life. The Númenoreans reacting not just to the arrival of *an elf*, but to the *brother of Elros Tar-Minyatur*. The Faithful would probably react with something approaching reverence, while to the King's Men, it would be an appalling affront, rubbing their faces into their own mortality and the deaths of their ancestors, while this immortal being, a kinsman no less, swanned about for 3,000 years. 

Galadriel's temperament doesn't really fit either character, but I'd be more accepting of it in Elrond, I think. He is a lot younger, and hasn't seen war except as a child. He had a very traumatic childhood; maybe there are some unresolved issues there which lead to his lashing out, and which might be assuaged through learning about his brother's life in Númenor. 

And also, of course, Galadriel should actually be in Eregion at this point in the timeline, not halfway to Valinor, which is a nice side effect.",14,27
4,TRUE,"Why would Adar let Arondir go WITH WEAPONS? How many seconds could Theo outrun orcs on a bum leg?  I was expecting Arondir to pick him up over his shoulder and running (in slow motion, of course) until they reached safety",14,28
4,TRUE,"I liked Adar's reveal, but I have doubts he's Sauron.

I wonder if he's supposed to be either Eöl or Maeglin, the only two 'evil' Elves. I know the books say they die, but Maeglin was tossed into the flames. Adar has a burn on his face. Hmm.",14,29
4,TRUE,"I think if Amazon released all episodes at once, it would have been much better. I am guessing some stuff will make sense, hopefully, at the end of the season.

I hope Adar is not Maglor since I cannot envision how a son of Feanor is implied to be the father of orcs, but leaks claim that he hates Sauron -so maybe that. I did not get where does Adar’s allegiances lie at this point.

There is a lot of going on but at the same time, nothing. Was the mine collapse scene important at all if Durin IV is not going to continue digging “too greedily”? Was it just to mention Earendil the star father? 

Galadriel is horrible in all aspects. I keep thinking that show might be doing this delibaretely to give her a character arc until she develops what we see in LOTR. Meeting her with Celeborn and settling for Lorien all being parts of it. But she is a pain in the ass to watch.

H = S is almost confirmed if you ask me, and I would be quite okay with starting this series a repentant Sauron. However, if he will be lurking around Numenor this season since he stays, how are we getting the forging of the rings in the next season? 

Celebrimbor is sus, although it can be bad writing as well.

I mean, why would men of Numenor go to Middle Earth to help elves to defeat some evil they know nothing about right now? How does Pharazon accept sending their men?

And lastly: I am not hating the Southlands arc, orcs are scary, I am okay with Theo being corrupt, I assume most of the men would bend the knee to the orcs as well if they can keep their land. But its like, if H = S, is he aware what is going on right now in the Southlands? Is this a masterplan or should we believe that he is repentant? Amidst all the storylines, this one forces me to keep watching.",14,30
4,TRUE,"Why the fuck would durin spend ten minutes talking about how mithril is sacred and make elrond swear to never tell the tale and then give him a fucking sample


Also, every elf except Arondir is awfully cast and awfully acted. Legitimately shit lines and awful delivery of shit lines",17,31
4,TRUE,"Only one palantir left? Wut? Had the palantir even been made at this point? 
Iirc the 7 palantir were spread across Arnor and Gondor well before any of them started going missing.",13,32
4,TRUE,"A weird theory but they really focused on Elrond swearing “by the mountain” that he wouldn’t tell another soul about the mithril, or his and his kin’s life would be doomed to sorrow.

What if he ends up telling Celebrimbor or someone else and that’s why his and his families life is so shit later on in LOTR and the hobbit? With him failing to destroy the ring with Isildur, his wife dying to orcs, nearly losing his daughter to death before losing her completely to the gift of man?",12,33
4,TRUE,"I've reached the conclusion that a big problem I'm having with the way the writing is developed is that many of the characters feel written backwards for the roles they're playing in the narrative.

--Bronwyn should have been the one captured by orcs and the energetic, dynamic actor playing Arondir should have been trying to rescue her these past few episodes.  Maybe he could defy orders to do so, thus giving the romance angle an even more powerful dynamic.

--Elrond is half-human ... he should be the one grappling with headstrong, impatient tendences, not Galadriel ... or, if you don't want to go that route, the way he's presently written means that he should be the one engaged in diplomacy in Numenor.  Meanwhile, Galadriel's personality, as shown thus far in the show, would better lend themselves to her bashing rocks and sneaking around Moria.

The King lying in bed should be cautious of war, while the Queen Regent should want to sail forth.

Isildur should be the cocky, primed for glory, popular teen and one of his friends should be the soft, moist eyed, weak willed dude who wrecks Isildur's career during a team exercise, thus forcing Isildur to learn the value of teamwork and humility.",16,34
4,TRUE,What I really liked in this Episode is Ar-Pharazon is not yet the corrupted one he will be once Sauron wispers in his ears. He still is pretty much a balanced character willing to give the benefit of the doubt. This can move us into very interesting character development,13,35
4,TRUE,"I'm sorry but Elrond and Galadriel took even more levels in jerk this episode. I don't think Book Galadriel would ever be tossed into prison, even a human one, but TV Galadriel was even more arrogant here than before, which says a lot. What right does Elrond have to go sneaking around Durin's mine? If Durin has secrets, Elrond should leave him to them unless there's evidence of evildoing. And why is the rock password in Common (or whatever) and not Dwarf language?  
  
Why is there only 1 palantir and 6 are said to be lost? Book Canon had numerous palantiri in Numenor and Elendil took 7 of them to Middle-Earth.  
  
How in the world is Numenor sinking in the palantir vision not completely lore breaking? How is Miriel not shouting from the rooftops that worshipping Sauron and destroying the white tree is what causes the vision? Especially as Akallabeth made it very clear that Numenor's sinking was a last minute decision--Manwe conceded his authority to Eru when Pharazon invaded and Eru decided on the spot to sink Numenor. It was not an open, pre-existing Valar threat via palantir saying, ""Yo Numenoreans, keep in line or we'll sink you"".  
  
Speaking of Pharazon, he seems pretty nice for someone who Tolkien says is so evil that he's destined to stay buried alive in eternal torment until the end of the world.  
  
So what did Elendil's wife die of? I think her dying early is another show invention. It's mentioned in passing when Isildur's former friends beat him up over causing their firing from the sea guard.  
  
So I'm guessing Theo and the old geezer he's collaborating with now are future Nazgul right?  
  
Why was Halbrand walking free from jail in a passing shot towards the end of the episode?",15,36
4,TRUE,I really like the Dwarven soldiers. Their masks are super cool and I love seeing them on screen. It also helps to imagine what it might have been like when the dwarves and elves fought. They would have been terrifying enemies.,11,37
4,TRUE,"Against my will, am beginning to wonder if the show has decided to dispense with the entire ""Annatar Lord of Gifts seducing the Elves"" storyline, and instead the writers have somehow made Sauron the shapechanger replace Celebrimbor himself.

That would be an shocking twisting of Tolkien's writings, but so would Meteorman or Halbrand as Sauron, too. But now am leaning towards Celembrimbor actually being Sauron in disguise.",12,38
4,TRUE,"I'm worried, with Galadriel being the main protagonist and adversary to Sauron, about what is going to happen at the climax of this story. Sauron is ultimately defeated by Gil-Galad and Elendil in Dagorlad. Galadriel is nowhere to be found at that point. Is she going to be in Mordor with the Last Alliance? Is she going to deliver the killing blow to Sauron after he kills Gil-Galad and Elendil?",11,39
4,TRUE,"I was reading Unfinished Tales and came across some interesting stuff…

-Tar-Miriel in book canon is forced to marry Pharazon, and presumably held hostage, show hasn’t hinted at conflict between them yet. I feel that show-Pharazon will simply assume power while she’s gone.

-Galadriel is in Eregion a lot in UT and never in the southlands. She kind of needs to get to Eregion by end of season to be the one to see through Sauron’s disguise right? That’s kind of her whole arc. I fear there may be some “fast-traveling” in the show’s future.

-Annatar doesn’t just proclaim to be an elf but a literal “emissary of the Valar.” Makes sense if he is in Lindon next ep whispering in Gil-Galad’s ear or disguised as Gil-Galad himself. would explain Gil-Galad thinking he has authority to choose who gets to go back to Valinor as well as the corrupted leaf (misdirected to be caused by meteor man).

-they haven’t set up the guild of elven smiths in eregion at all. Celebrimbor plot is very little screentime for how important he is. I wonder if this will be developed or if it’s just Celebrimbor solo doing the forging in show-verse.

-it will be interesting to see how the show handles Sauron’s sack of Eregion and near conquering of Lindon. I feel like it’s gonna be weird for him to teleport an army to Eregion from Southlands. And also weird for Numenor to send yet another army to save the day to a different coast (although I guess that’s kinda Numenor’s thing, but halfway through season one they are just now leaving for the Southlands I don’t see how the pieces on the board get there from now.)

-there’s some interesting discrepancy with Gil-Galad in some versions holding on to the ring of fire maybe a little too long and not giving it to Cirdan right away. It’s implied he kept it for some reason and was maybe tempted to use it in the Last Alliance war. could he be tempted to use it openly on show-verse?

-Elendil is the one who writes down the Aldarion and Erendis tale as it is of particular interest to him, and it’s one of the few Numenorian tales that survived the fall. I know the show doesn’t have the rights to UT but I could see why they might transfer aspects of Aldarion’s story onto Elendil, or have him the tell the tale himself like how Celebrimbor brought up Feanor.

-due to compressing the timelines I don’t see how the show is gonna have Sauron be in so many different places at once. He needs to show up in Numenor, Southlands, AND Eregion. And pretty soon too or those plots will stall out and not progress by next season. I guess maybe they fixed this problem by having a new character Adar running the show in Southlands.",12,40
4,TRUE,"Oh boy what a mess yet again... Were the writers and editors drunk when the produced this? 

I can't decide about the pace of this series. On one hand, it's a chaos of hurried scenes and storylines that follow up on each other way to quickly, end and continue in a weird way, and just seem to check of boxes to get to a certain point. There's no real setup and pay off. There's no rest or calmness to get comfortable, it feels like a rollercoaster. 

On the other hand, I find myself bored, waiting for something. It feels like the showrunners had certain ideas where they want to go to, and just filled it in with necessary scenes. Whether actors are good or bad doesn't matter anymore, because they have a very messy script and story to work with.",14,41

4,TRUE,Could Adar be Maglor? It would explain the burn marks and the mouth of Sirion comment.,9,43
4,TRUE,"Why is  Ar-Pharazôn a ""chancellor?"" I wasn't aware Númenor had chancellors. Isn't he supposed to be the King? Or are they setting him up to become King later when he gets corrupted?",9,44
4,TRUE,"I liked Elrond recounting part of the story about his father. It's hard to work in thousands of years of backstories and am glad that one made the cut.
Loved the scene where she sings to the stone of the mountain,  faithful to the source material and hope they incorporate more songs that permeate the essence of creation.
I really disliked the references to ""The gods"". There is only one god, Eru Iluvatar, only one. The elves certainly would not have called the Valar ""gods"", perhaps long corrupted men and lesser Maiar (which Adar possibly is).
Galadriel is wrong about the Valar rewarding Numenor for being loyal to the elves. The reward was for fighting on the side of good vs evil. Perhaps she has some elvish Middle-Kingdom outlook on this Middle Earth. So either purposeful character flaw that she will lose over time in the show or a flaw in the show.
Just dislike the portrayal of Numenor in general. The show seems to take a big eraser to all aspects of the Middle Earth which deal directly with religion with passing references to ""the gods"" in lieu of showing Numenor being corrupted by Sauron into human sacrifice and turning away from Eru. The crumbling of faith in institutions could have been incorporated in ways that are relevant to today, as that seems to be a high priority to the show runners.
Does not look likely that Sauron will forever lose his beautiful form when Numenor is destroyed earlier than he planned as I don't see anyone beautiful in Numenor as a candidate to be Sauron. Could be wrong, might just happen later.

Glad there were no Harfoots in this episode but hope it doesn't mean Harfoots centric episodes in the future. (Unless the Stranger ends up being a super early Gandalf to the party) then some is forgiven.

Still wish that all the different storylines were all occuring at different times like the Witcher TV show did but it is what it is.",8,45
4,TRUE,"I may be completely off but after thinking about this episode's info, it seems like Meteor Man may indeed be Sauron.  
  
The evil geezer from the village says the meteor is a sign. Why would Sauron's forces be expecting the meteor if it's from the Valar carrying a wizard?  
  
We now know that Theo's morgul blade isn't just a morgul blade, but the very one item that Adar and his orc forces are hunting. One does wonder though why the evil geezer, who apparently knew Theo stole the blade, didn't just steal it back and give it to them.  
  
If Meteor Man is Sauron, why is he seemingly friendly and amnesiac?  
  
Here's my theory. Sauron knew Galadriel was hunting him. So he stored his memories into Theo's Morgul Blade and became an amnesiac hobo, so if Galadriel did find him she'd be unable to read his mind to determine his identity. Once Galadriel was confirmed to sail off to Valinor, one of Sauron's allies (maybe a balrog or a dragon?) launched Sauron back into Middle-Earth from hiding via meteor. Adar, who works for Sauron, is supposed to get the Morgul Blade containing Sauron's memories and return it to Meteor Man, who will be restored into his full glory as Sauron and annihilate the Harfoots as his first act upon restoration. He'll then travel to Eregion to make the Rings, with the Morgul Blade memory storage gimmick he just used as a trial run for him putting his own power into the One Ring.  
  
Thoughts?",7,46

5,TRUE,this whole “we need mithril for our life force” thing feels like random Marvel universe kind of crap and I don’t like it.,66,5
5,TRUE,"Celebrimbor wants to use *mithril* to ""saturate every last Elf in the light of the Valar once more."" I found this statement strange, because there was never a time when every last Elf was exposed to the ""light of the Valar"" (unless you count the stars of Varda, but those still exist). Perhaps he could mean every last Noldo, but of course there are Noldor born in Middle-earth who never experienced the Trees.

I take it that by ""the light of the Valar"" he is referring to the light of the Trees, which is captured in the Silmarils, which then infused *mithril* because...lightning struck a tree with a Silmaril in its roots near where an Elf-lord and a Balrog were fighting? N.B. this can't be Glorfindel (or Ecthelion) at the fall of Gondolin, because Gil-galad explicitly places it at Hithaeglir, i.e. the Misty Mountains, so this is presumably a new story/legend and the Balrog is likely to be Dúrin's Bane, unless there was more than one Balrog in the same area. This also pretty much confirms that *mithril* does not exist on Númenor in the show universe, and possibly not even in Aman.

Let's leave aside for the moment the question of whether *mithril* has any light in it (we have zero indication that it does) or whether there would be a Silmaril under a tree in the Misty Mountains (presumably it would have to be the one Maedhros cast himself into the fiery chasm with, but it's not clear to me how the earth would have moved it up into the mountains enough to infuse the roots of a tree). The Sun and Moon *also* contain the light of the Two Trees, being the last fruit of Laurelin and the last flower of Telperion, and there is also a star which consists of a Silmaril. So why is the light of the Sun, Moon, and Eärendil not enough to sustain the Elves, but the light that is supposedly in *mithril* is?

I think there are three possible explanations. 

(1) Gil-galad and Celebrimbor are simply incorrect (perhaps they have been deceived by a certain someone?), they don't need any light from *mithril* or anything else, and something else is causing the blight.

(2) The show's universe has invented, in one fell swoop: a new backstory for *mithril*, a new backstory for the Elves (that they were all exposed to the light of the Trees), a new property for *mithril* (it emits light), a new property of Elves (they depend on the light of the Trees to survive), a different backstory for the Sun and Moon (we don't know what yet, but they can't be created from the Trees or the Elves wouldn't need light from *mithril*), and a different nature for the star Eärendil (Elrond mentioned in the last episode that the Valar had lifted his father up to become a star, but I don't think they have explicitly stated that he carries a Silmaril on his brow). This would take the show *way* out of ""adaptation"" territory and well into the realm of ""loosely inspired fanfiction"" in my opinion.

(3) The writers thought that *mithril* having the light of a Silmaril and the Elves needing it for that reason would make a cool story and didn't really think through the implications.

I hope it's (1) but I fear it's (3). If I've gone wrong in my analysis please let me know; this whole idea just struck me as bizarre and poorly thought out.

...

It's a separate point, but when Gil-galad is telling the story of how *mithril* was created, he says, ""Forging of their [the Elf-lord and the Balrog's] conflict, a power...A power as pure and light as good. As strong and unyielding as evil."" This idea that it contains both good and evil properties and that its power somehow lies in the balance of the two strikes me as rather un-Tolkienish; Tolkien tends to see evil as just evil, something to be shunned, not as a complement to good.",66,6
5,TRUE,"They keep giving us half the information, over and over. You can do it with one plot line, but it’s getting pretty old with Meteor Bro and Blood Sword of Doom at the same time. Why did the elves have some evil crap on their tower anyway? And now we have androgynous evil character who wants to find Meteor Bro? Again, the viewer is supposed to care but we don’t know why. Someone needs to tell the writers it’s ok if the viewer knows more than the characters. Watch any detective show to see how this is done guys.

Clearly the milthril thing ain’t gonna work for the elves, so someone’s going to suggest magic rings.  

Isildur is also insufferable because we have no idea what his problem really is. We have conflict with no explanation for said conflict. So why should we care about this character? Just because he’s another sad, confused twenty something living at home who doesn’t know if he wants to get a job or go to college or smoke pipe weed all day?

I was getting more into it but it went back to episode 1/2 level of pacing and crock of orc dung writing.",57,7
5,TRUE,"**What I loved about this episode:** 

The opening shots of the Harfoots traveling through what I believe are the Eastern Lands. I loved the solemn emptiness of those landscapes. I also loved the song they sang. It was incredibly beautiful. I like the  less popular theory about the stranger being “the man on the moon” from the song Frodo sings in the Prancing Pony. The two ethereal shots of the Moon in the Sky make me want to believe this theory is true but who knows. 

Like always, I also enjoyed all the scenes with Elrond and Durin. I think their chemistry and friendship feels like one of the most organic parts of the show and Durin's humor is a breath of fresh air compared to the stiffness of a lot of the other characters. The only thing that irks me a little bit is the two of them jumping from Eregion  to Lindon without ever showing just how far they are traveling to get there.

**What I disliked about this episode:** 

The depiction of the Elves and the concept of Mithril being this divine ore which will save the Elves from destruction. I really don’t understand where they are going with this and this whole subplot feels forced and very un-Tolkien.

I also didn’t really like the slow-ish fight choreography in the scene where Galadriel essentially shows off her swordsmanship to the Númenorians and beats around 10 of them. Some of the the actions scenes feel very slowed down and “weightless” which gives it a goofy tone. I would like to see some better fight choreography in the next episodes.

On top of it all, I'm a bit tired of them down-playing Galadriel's imposing mental and magical abilities while over emphasizing her physical abilities. There are way more ways to showcase character strength and ability than insane swordsmanship. I hope the showrunners are aware of this as they continue to develop her character.",57,8
5,TRUE,"1) I want to enjoy this so badly but it’s incredibly slow

2) the silmaril / mithril / elves fading story makes my retcon meter go crazy, but is arguably the most interesting part of the episode 

3) Halbrand is a smith with some interesting sword skills, who abandoned his fellows at sea, and is making his way out of a Numenorean prison. Not a new idea but he’s Sauron to me. I also like the story line if that’s the case because he gets so close to Galadriel",51,9

5,TRUE,"I know it's not the case, but it really feels like the show is just trolling me at this point haha, trying to see how much lore deviation I can take by increasing it every episode. Will you swallow Gil-Galad determining access to Valinor? How bout Elendil being a nobody? MAGA Numenoreans? Still with us? Ok this week, Elves need to be saturated by mithril(???) or they die. At this point I just find it funny more than anything.

Frankly, even disregarding its lore-breaking nature, the mithril thing barely makes sense. Mithril supposedly contains the light of a Silmaril, which is the light of the Two Trees, which apparently Elves need in order to not die. Yet the vast majority of Elves have not seen the light of the Two Trees or the Silmarils (I'm pretty sure this is even true in the show world, because in the first episode Galadriel emphasizes that she has seen the light of the Trees, implying she is special), and they've been fine for the past few thousand years? And why then can Elves still live forever in Valinor? There aren't any Trees or Silmarils there right? I know Gil-Galad mentions ""the Light of the Valar"" but how are the Trees the light of the Valar in some way that the Sun and the Moon are not. 

I know some people are saying maybe this is just one of Annatar's lies, which I think again shows how the show's structure inhibits any real discussion. Every nonsensical plot point can be explained away by ""oh they're gonna address that in the next episode"", which so far hasn't happened. Also even if it's a lie of Annatar honestly it just makes Gil-Galad and Celebrimbor look really stupid. (Also shouldn't they both have been alive when the myth of the tree of Hithaeglir supposedly happened? Nobody was like, shouldn't we all help the guy get the Silmaril out of that tree?)",36,19

It's not any one thing, it's just a bunch of different elements that aren't joining together to form an engaging show. It's just mediocrity across the board.

It really seems like so much effort was put into recreating Tolkiens world that they also forgot that the show had to be interesting and that it would not automatically be engaging because Tolkien.",29,23
5,TRUE,"Some questions about the plot:

Why are the humans and Arondir staying in that tower? They can see the orcs coming, it's at least hours until they climb up the mountain, maybe days of head start if they just run away. They have no food (that cart load would be one day for the crowd that was there), so why not escape?

Why hasn't a single Numenorean, pro- or anti elf, asked what this 'alliance' Galadriel wants entails from the elf side? hat army will they join with to fight orcs? If they think there is an elf army, why bother sending 3 ships of poorly trained soldiers since it will hardly make a difference, if there isn't what exactly is this talk of an alliance and following the traditions about?

Why does every single event have to have this back and forth plot structure; it won't happen, it will happen, it won't happen, it will, it won't...then it happens...? It's tedious, not clever writing and just cheapens characters that are supposed to be serious and concerned with big things.",29,24
5,TRUE,"I think people are being too hard on the mithril subplot. I think it will end up being based on Celebrimbor and Gil-Galad having been mislead by Annatar, and the damage to the tree has more to do with a taint of Sauron than the fading of the Elves. 

That said, while the mithil-silmaril connection doesn't occur in the books, the idea that mithril could help to slow the fading of the Eldar in Middle-Earth is a pretty reasonable extrapolation from what does. Celebrimbor didn't say they'd flood each of the Eldar in the light of mithril just by making them sit next to rocks. It's obviously connected with his plan to build his uber-forge, and he obviously intends to use mithril in some sort of construst which will draw on it's power to slow the fading. And that does come directly from the books!  Nenya, the Ring held by Galadriel, is made of mitrhril, by Celebrimbor, and used to maintain Loth-Lorien in an artificial imitation of the lands of the Eldar in ancient times. That's the device that Celebrimbor is building, and the only real change is the suggestion that some of it's powers derive from the material properties of mithril. 

So even if the plot did develop entirely as implied in this episode, it's barely a departure from the words on the page, just introduced a bit clumsily. It is only filling in where details weren't provided, and fits precisely with the details that were. It may or may not be to our tastes, but it actually respects the architecture of the Second Age much more than other changes, it oughtn't be particularly controversial.",30,25

Episode 5

(Episode [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/xfgxa1/bookfocused_discussion_megathread_for_the_rings/iootjkk/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/x9ngql/z/insnpfk), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/x3qfr2/z/imxwnsk), [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/x3qfr2/z/imt9yy8))

* Writer: Doble

* Director: Yip

* I'm really leaning towards the Stranger being Olórin after seeing his remorse over the fireflies. I think the meteor itself my have some connection to Sauron, but the man inside it just screams ""Gandalf"" to me. Perhaps Olórin and Mairon were having some sort of celestial battle, Sauron cast Gandalf down in the meteor, and that's why he lost his memory? Pure conjecture here.

* ""Not all who wonder or wander are lost"" obviously repurposes a line from the Aragorn poem (and which has become a popular bumper sticker). There have been a few times that they've used phrasing that comes from Tolkien but in completely different context like this, as I noted last week in my write-up on the *palantír*. The PJ movies did this as well. I liked the song and the montage of Harfoot migration.

* So we get a brief glimpse of the cultists, who are clearly interested in the meteor. It would be odd if they are Sauron worshippers, since Aragorn tells us confidently that Sauron ""does not use white."" But perhaps they don't know that much about Sauron? Waldreg certainly doesn't; ""You are Sauron, right?"" almost made me laugh.

* Were those supposed to be Wargs chasing the Harfoots? They looked different to me than the Warg that Arondir fought, but maybe it's just that that one was so beat up.

* ""Stone Giants of the North Moors"" is an interesting double reference - [more here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/xlmuu5/bookfocused_discussion_megathread_for_the_rings/ipls0ib/)

* (Is Dúrin implying that the Noldor stole a Dwarven monument or even a tomb and made it into a table?! And Gil-galad is just like, ok you can have it back? Perhaps they are trying to show us how Elves have exploited Dwarves in the past to set up the *mithril* storyline. It was just kind of a weird exchange.) Wrote this one before finishing the episode, but thought I'd leave it in as my initial reaction.

* [*Mithril* - it has what plants crave](https://youtu.be/kAqIJZeeXEc)

* I had far too much to say about *mithril* so I put it in a separate comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/xlmuu5/bookfocused_discussion_megathread_for_the_rings/iplwy8x/)

* Can't say I'm a big fan of Gil-galad's personality in this show. He manipulated the Dwarves through Elrond, and openly admits to Elrond that he sent Galadriel away to try to cure the blight (not to honor her or give her rest as he claimed in the first episode). That means he also manipulated Elrond into encouraging his close friend Galadriel to go (a revelation which Elrond didn't seem to react to at all). Basically he's dishonest and manipulative to everyone he meets. Perhaps he's being manipulated himself by Annatar, but book Gil-galad saw through Annatar and turned him away. And with the whole *mithril* plan being so far-fetched it seems that this incarnation of our boy Ereinion isn't especially smart.

Overall a weird episode to me. I will admit I got very hung up on the *mithril* claims which are bizarre and, if true, have massive implications for the whole nature of the world. But I did quite like the splendor of the Númenóreans departing on their ships.",30,26

For Numenor I hope we get the “Death and the desire for deathlessness” piece. The corruption of the gift of mortality.

5,TRUE,"*Not all those who wander or wonder are lost* - nice callback to the lines composed by Bilbo for Aragorn. Given that the Harfoots are the ancestors of the Hobbits, it even makes sense that Bilbo takes a few words from an ancient song for a poem about a king from an ancient culture.

I have a problem with the shadow blade, or however one wants to call it. The key to what? And why is there an overgrown statue in an elvish watchtower depicting it?

Meteor Man - could he be one of the Istari? I know, I know, that's not how they show up in the book, but still, it would somehow fit. The memory loss could be explained as a side effect of their transformation into this form.

The mithril plotline: I believe Sauron (without anyone knowing, of course) is the source of this rumour in order to influence Gil-Galad by spreading the rumour, thus aiming for the creation of the Rings. Otherwise, this plotline would be rather stupid, and until now, the show did not seem to be that stupid.",20,33

5,TRUE,"Am I the only one thinking the Mithril plot is just to provide material and reason for making the Rings of Power? At least the Elven Rings? Those rings were made to maintain the Eleven Kingdoms so they don't fade and last into the third age, the Blight Being a physical representation of that perhaps. The mithril plot, is probably a way to set up why the Elves, Dwarves and Men all got Rings Of Power by the events of LOTR. Dwarves by providing Mithril, Elves for making them (With Sauron's guidance ofc) and Men for fighting against Sauron in some way. I actually think, the coveting of Mithril by the Elves (With the made from a lost Silmaril explanation) kind of makes sense, considering how much Elf blood was spilt over it but..... I doubt the Mithril will actually work as this cure for the Blight thing. My guess is it would set up Annatar and the need for the creation of the rings, maybe even Durin's Bane idk.",21,36

5,TRUE,"After 5 episodes, I just genuinely don't know what my opinion of this show is. I'm overall enjoying it, and I see a lot of positives, but some of the choices being made are so confusing to me. I think it would be a bad and unnecessary change if the writers decide that the elves actually do need the mithril to slow their diminishing, but it would be an okay plot point if that's a lie from Sauron. It would also tie into Halbrand's line about teaching people to master their fears so you can master them (assuming Halbrand is Sauron, which I think he is).

Visually, it's a stunning show, and has some of the most creative and beautiful design work I've seen in a long time, but so far the overall story feels like they wrote a bunch of great scenes and then tried to find a storyline that would tie them all together.

I would've also liked to see Numenor really show its military strength here, rather than just send a few hundred volunteers. This force is even smaller than the faithful that survived the downfall of Numenor.",18,43

The whole ""will it, won't it, no it won't, but then key character does a thing and now it will"" thing has really been beaten to death excessively at this point, and we are only a few episodes in.

The payoffs for the show's big mysteries - who is the comet stranger, who is Halbrand, what happens to the ppl of the Southlands, etc - is moving at such an excruciatingly slow pace that any sense of suspense &amp; tension associated with their reveals, feels lost at the moment. The second the big stranger guy used his magic to save the Harfoots, I thought to myself ""welp, there's this arc's headline moment of the week. Nothing else significant will happen now"".

The *fëa* is then able to travel freely to Aman. It is an individual process, presumably one that is felt before it just suddenly happens in a few months, and has nothing to do with the light of the Trees.

If anything, I would expect the light of the Trees to strengthen the *fëa*, making it consume the *hröa* more quickly, and thus quicken the fading, rather than delay it. Elves and humans are ""in biological terms one race"" (Letter 153), so their *hröar* work the same - they are not photosynthetic!",17,50

6,TRUE,"As someone who loves and studies both geology and Tolkien’s legendarium, I appreciated the concept of the Orodruin “key” operating a kind of gravity-fed, landscape-scale, orcish (Urûk is more PC?) “Rube Goldberg” machine, emptying a reservoir in Ered Lithui, which triggers a violent, Pélean hydromagmatic eruption of the volcano.  The lava bombs were a great touch, though there should have been tephra of all sizes, from bomb, to lapilli, to just regular ashfall, along with with pyroclastic density current.  In reality, PDCs are not “on fire” as some kind of melodramatic gasoline-induced movie explosion, but, as the name suggests, are dense, turbulent, high-speed, gravity-driven clouds of extremely hot, but not quite molten material. Most of it would give off visible light in daylight, and the vast amounts of ash would smother any fire set in its wake.  However, at night, PDCs do glow, which gives them one of their other names, *Nueés Ardentes* (French for “glowing/incandescent cloud”).

The show missed a crucial opportunity to show an umbrella cloud of ash above the volcano blotting out the sun and raining down ash all over “the southlands”, which would be more geologically accurate, and also move the story forward, showing the transformation of the once habitable land into the Plateau of Gorgoroth.  Maybe we will see much more ashfall next week.  There should be a truly massive umbrella cloud and ash plume, because beyond the Plateau of Gorgoroth, the larger southeastern region of Mordor called Lithlad (“ash plain”), should be covered in ash, which was originally the vast, fertile farmlands of the men of the south, and the inland sea of Nurnen, which irrigated their fields, was spoiled by the ashfall.

But anyway, really cool episode.  Overall, despite some major departures from the legendarium, I have come to thoroughly enjoy this series by enjoying it as a kind of parallel Tolkien-esque fantasy.

The orcs chanting “Udûn” was weird because it’s not a name of Orodruin/Amon Amarth/Mt. Doom, but it is the name of the bowl-shaped depression northwest of Orodruin, which formed a kind of vestibular region to the Gates of Mordor, guarding inner Mordor.  FWIW, in terms of geology, I always interpreted Udûn and the Plains of Gorgoroth as a set of ancient, overlapping, down-dropped calderas, with Orodruin rising as a kind of Somma volcano in the center.  Though in reality, post-caldera volcanoes tend to be built up on the edges of calderas, around their ring (no pun intended) faults, which is where the vents of caldera “supervolcanoes” form and erupt from.",45,18

6,TRUE,"The whole turning the key to open the big water sluice reminded me of the type of things that happen in the early James Bond films. Not very Tolkienesque. 

I don’t like the meandering plot with the hilt being passed from one character to another, dropping hints and non sequiturs about it, like at the beginning when it looks like it’s going to corrupt Theo but eventually he gives it away. 

Doesn’t make sense thar Númenor would send an expedition with the Queen Regent herself to save a little village from a band of orcs. 

The production is still excellent but it’s disappointing to see that they really don’t know which story to tell. A lot of what goes on ends up being inconsequential",34,26

Having no one discover it till Halbrand looked at it right before the eruption was just cheap.

I really thought they would have Halbrand steal it so he becomes corrupted. I really hope he just doesn't turn out to be a boring hero.",33,28
6,TRUE,"I have a question about this episode (and the previous ones):  
There is an outpost with hundreds of elves. The task is to watch over a valley with humans and protect the humans from themselves and other beings. Orcs attack and after a few episodes only Arondir is alive. He finds a weapon belonging to the most powerful evil there is. Why does he keep fighting the orcs and helping the humans instead of taking the humans to the elves and warning the elves about the evil power?",31,29
6,TRUE,These orcs are scary shit,31,30
6,TRUE,"While I enjoyed this ep, I really wish TV battles utilised realistic strategy more often. Arondir seemed like the most inept battle planner this ep.

Firstly, if you are fighting an organised army and all you have are some farmers, you're probably better off running until you can find a larger force to rally with.

If you do fight, then the most defensible position is the place he destroyed. It had high walls and a narrow point of approach. If you could hold out until morning you'd have the advantage of the sun, which the orcs hates. Arondir just destroyed it to kill barely a handful of their force. Such a waste of a resource.

Even weirder when you see where they do make their stand. A town with literally no walls that could not possibly repel any organised force.

Then their only point of retreat is a dead end, easily breachable building that offers no protection.

Then no one of high rank even checks the weapon the enemy was carrying before handing it off to a child.",35,31
6,TRUE,"I feel insane, everyone thinks halbrand is Sauron when the show I just watched just re-affirmed otherwise",28,32
6,TRUE,"Could someone tell me the reason why Sauron would hide a sword that can be used as a key to trigger a volcanic eruption for the purpose of creating Mordor? 

Couldn't he have just, you know, triggered the eruption at any point by himself, enabling him to hold on to the hilt and not let it fall into the hands of a young troublemaker like Theo?",28,33
6,TRUE,"In order to continue enjoying the show and more easily suspend disbelief, I think I’m going to just have to accept they’re working with 1/16 scale Arda. A compressed map for a compressed timeline I guess. 

3 weeks from Numenor to Middle Earth? nope, just a couple days. 150 miles from the mouth of the Anduin to the future spot of Osgiliath? Nah, we can sail up that river against the current in a day. Elendil’s great x35 grandson is going to take 7 days to march from Minas Tirith to the Black Gate? Nah, we can get from the boats all the way to the valley under Mt Doom in half a day with our horses. 

All the teleporting everyone has been doing in between episodes makes more sense if everything is shrunk. Suddenly the timelines are much easier to align. 

It’s like they’re using the LOTRO map scale for reference. At this scale, Frodo could have actually gone from the Shire to Mt Doom in the time it takes to watch the extended trilogy.  

I kid. 

Seriously though, I’m going to just have to let this issue go. It unfortunate because the massiveness of Tolkien’s world is something I loved about it. Perhaps when the world is made round Eru will also stretch it out just a bit.",26,34
6,TRUE,"This might seem like a really small nitpick but it's the kind of unnecessary change that I can't stand.

Was anyone else bothered by Arondir's line ""The Elves say there's a Vala that watches over the plants"" or something like that, as though the Valar are mythical? I don't know if we know what clan of Elves he's from, but presumably he has spoken with Elves who have seen and spoken with the Valar personally. I feel like he should 100% *know* there's a Vala for the plants and know that her name is Yavanna.",24,35
6,TRUE,"The more I'm watching this show the more I feel like each scene is only good while you're watching it, and falls apart when considered as part of a broader story.

I mean, the show keeps together, mostly, but with this episode especially I felt it. How did the Numenoreans know to go to bumfuck knowheresville? Why did Galadriel go there immediately? As soon as I saw the map I thought ""lmao shouldn't they be going to an actual port somewhere"". Why didn't Galadriel check the thing they literally told her was the only reason to chase that guy? Didn't anybody think to check it?

Really felt like they cut about 20+ minutes of the show here.

Also, I feel like black speech should not be a thing yet. When did Sauron have a chance to design it?",24,36

((Episode [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/xlmuu5/bookfocused_discussion_megathread_for_the_rings/ipml09e/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/xfgxa1/bookfocused_discussion_megathread_for_the_rings/iootjkk/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/x9ngql/z/insnpfk), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/x3qfr2/z/imxwnsk), [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/x3qfr2/z/imt9yy8))

* Writers: Adams, Doble, Payne, McKay

* Director: Charlotte Brandstrom

* On a structural note, I felt it was remarkable that this episode featured only two of the four plot threads (leaving out the Harfoots and Lindon/Eregion/Moria), and merged them midway through. I haven't had many complaints about the pacing overall, but I think I noted on episode 3 or 4 that only focusing on three groups per episode gave each storyline a little more room to breathe than in the first two episodes, and I felt that episode 5 suffered a bit from having so much to cover. Hopefully this episode puts to rest the debates about whether enough is ""happening"" (which never made much sense to me anyway).

* Speaking of multiple storylines, it's been a bit disorienting trying to navigate the timeline without specific points of reference (such as the meteor). I would have guessed prior to this episode that *more* time had elapsed in Galadriel's storyline from the meteor to the end of the last episode than in the Southlands, but given that the episode opens with Galadriel and Isildur still on a ship and the battle in the Southlands already starting, it would seem that the Galadriel/Númenor storyline has actually been running behind. I would guess they keep a ""show bible"" with dates of events in it to keep everything straight - it would be nice to see dates attached to events so we can coordinate things more clearly and get a better sense of, e.g. how long the ships take to reach the Southlands from Númenor and how long the cavalry takes to ride from the ships.

* I like how they snuck in the word *gimbatul* (""find them!"") - good use of attested Black Speech. We don't know enough about the grammar of Black Speech to know if the form should really be the same in the imperative mood, but it was a nice little nod to the Ring-verse.

* Elendil says that he has always looked east over the sea and west over land - this implies that he has lived on the east coast of Númenor. Why not in Andúnië?

* ""This shadow is but a passing thing. There is light and beauty forever beyond its reach."" This line recalled for me the sunlight falling upon the fallen head of the statue of the king at the crossroads: ""‘They cannot conquer for ever!’ said Frodo.""

* I understand the desire to include romance, but I really don't feel a need for it. Certainly whatever happens with Arondir and Bronwyn will not as momentous as Beren and Lúthien or Tuor and Idril, or Aragorn and Arwen reuniting the long-sundered branches of line of Eärendil and Elwing. I don't have a strong objections to including a newly invented Elf-Human romance, but it doesn't really feel necessary to me, either.

* More Quenya between Adar and Arondir. Is it just the lingua franca for the Elves?

* The charging Númenóreans were a sight to behold. Combat feels very physical/real - somewhat in contrast to the acrobatic combat of Galadriel vs the snow troll in the first episode.

* As a veterinarian I'm glad the horse was ok after Halbrand tripped it! I winced as I saw that moment coming.

* Joseph Mawle as Adar continues to be a standout performance

* The idea of taking Orcs as prisoners strikes me as somewhat odd - especially Galadriel threatening to torture them by bringing them into the sunlight. Tolkien does write a bit about this in *Morgoth's Ring*: ""If any Orcs surrendered and asked for mercy, they must be granted it, even at a cost…Few Orcs ever did so in the Elder Days, and at no time would any Orc treat with any Elf.""

* Adar had a nice explanation of the contrast between Morgoth's nihilism and Sauron's desire for order by Adar. From *Morgoth's Ring*, ""Note on motives in the Silmarillion"":

&gt;Melkor could do nothing with Arda, which was not from his own mind and was interwoven with the work and thoughts of others: even left alone he could only have gone raging on till all was levelled again into a formless chaos. And yet even so he would have been defeated, because it would still have existed, independent of his own mind, and a world in potential…Sauron had never reached this stage of nihilistic madness...it had been his virtue (and therefore also the cause of his fall, and of his relapse) that he loved order and coordination, and disliked all confusion and wasteful friction.

* ""The King we were promised"" - promised by whom? I feel like I missed something. It seemed quite abrupt for the Southlanders to just accept Halbrand as king. Contrast the slow build-up of Aragorn hesitantly entering Minas Tirith as a healer only for the rumor of his coming to spread. Of course, if Halbrand is indeed Sauron (and I think this episode hinted that he is), it would make sense that he is ready to accept such a kingship, but I don't quite understand why the Southlanders would be so ready to hand it to him, when none of them seem to recognize him aside from the little medallion he carries. Personally I am still hoping that Halbrand is *not* Sauron partly for these reasons and also because I think it is significant to Galadriel's character that she was not deceived by Annatar.

* I wonder if this is the last we've seen of the hilt? It seems like having it act as a key, albeit one that starts a very cataclysmic chain of events, doesn't fully explain why it's a sword and why the blade grows when exposed to blood. Makes me wonder if we'll see it again.",27,37
6,TRUE,"This is definitely the episode I liked the most so far, maybe because being so action-focused left less room for lore-defying conversations haha. 

Despite several nitpicky problems I had with the episode (particularly with the Southlanders battle tactics), I think this is the kind of episode that we should have had more of in this show: focused on one area, and fully resolving a plotline (Southlanders vs orcs) before moving on to the next (Mount Doom being formed). I also really liked the moment where Theo asks who’s that and Arondir says: “That’s Galadriel, Commander of the Northern Armies”. I feel like this was a moment that we needed way earlier in the show, to show Galadriel actually being respected. I think that would’ve made her character more plausible for me.

My biggest concern from this episode is Halbrand. I feel like his whole story so far makes no sense, whether he is or isn’t Sauron. If he’s not Sauron, he’s supposedly run out of the Southlands by orcs, then he decides to get on a boat and sail to who knows where (because he doesn’t seem aware of Numenor when they get there), decides he never wants to go back to Middle Earth, then decides he actually does, then when he gets back no one seems to have heard of him but are happy to call him king because he has a weird as yet unexplained pouch.

If he is Sauron, then I guess he was struck down by Adar in some way, fled to Numenor then either played the long con by saving Galadriel, pretending to want to be a blacksmith and playing coy about going back to the Southlands - or he was actually being repentant and really planned on just being a blacksmith. Both of these choices don’t really work for me. Also if Halbrand is Sauron, then the mithril thing surely can’t be a lie of Sauron, unless Sauron can astral project now or something. I’m sure this will be addressed in a future episode^TM",27,38
6,TRUE,"""that only counts as one""",22,39
6,TRUE,"Up through episode 5, I thought the show was okay.  It took some liberties with the lore, but for the most part I didn't think it was bad.  Episode 6 just make no sense.  At all.  Somehow, Galadriel and the Numenoreans sail from Numenor to the exact spot they need to go to rescue the Southlands village...in a day.  Yes, a day.  So far, everything in the show has been running at the same time.  This isn't some poor plot timing where Galadriel's plot was not happening in sync with everyone elses.  And setting aside the fast travel, how did they know the EXACT place to go.  The Southlands are big and Halbrand has been gone for a while if he was on a random boat in the middle of the ocean.  Regardless of what little he did know of the orc movements, he definitely didn't know their precise location.  So the whole 'timely' arrival to save the day comes off as lazy writing and contrived.

Then we have the whole master plan of the key.  A key that unlocks a dam to free the water.  Except there were no tunnels when the dam/tower/keep was built so where did they think the water was going to go?  Also, why bother with the key at all?  It's a dam, just break the wall.  They didn't need the key at all.  So again, that whole plot point ends up coming off as contrived.

Everything about this episode was all flash with no sustenance.",26,40
6,TRUE,Just seemed too easy to beat the orcs for the villagers. Took me out of it. Bronwyn apparently became the leader and commander of the village for no reason. Now halbrand is king of like 20 people. Just miss elrond and durin,24,41
6,TRUE,"If the village had been bigger it would have had a bigger impact on me.  Númenor sailing all that way to help 50 people after 100 orca attacted just seemed so lackluster to me.  They were trying for a helms deep situation and it fell flat.  What action they had was good, not great but good.  Imagine how devastating the volcano erupting would be if a bigger village suffered from it? There were parts I enjoyed but I gave up on this show being amazing after the first episode.  I think it would be better if it wasn’t a LOTR show and an original fantasy series. The whole reason I got excited when it was announced was to see Annatar, who I don’t think we’ll see, to see the cult of Morgoth and the Nazgûl rise and fall, to see the last alliance I dont think we’ll get that till season 3 if we get one.  I’m disappointed that it’s not what I expected or wanted but it’s whatever.  It’s a show you have to not dig too deep and ask questions about that at times looks amazing, has moments and things that kinda feel like middle earth but not what I’d make if I could. I like Durin, Arondir, Elrond and Adar. And that myth about mithril was cool. But I’d have rather got something completely original than this.",23,42
6,TRUE,"I feel like that was backwards. Maybe start defending the village, then fall back to the tower, finally drop the tower on them and flee. While fleeing through an open plain the very conveniently timed cavalry could arrive. 

Upside Arondir had a fight that was actually back and forth where a main character had to struggle to win. That was nice.",25,43
6,TRUE,So they just awoke Mordor I guess? Was that mount doom? Holy shit!,19,44
6,TRUE,"I think I enjoyed more about this episode than any other and that was due to the action mostly being well done and also Adar. I'm absolutely gutted that he looks to be a season 1 character only. I was unironically rooting for him during his conversation with Galadriel. I believed him and I sympathised with him. Especially when he said they were as deserving of life as anyone else. He's absolutely correct. They didn't choose to be made or to be made as they are. I loved that and it was one of the few genuinely interesting ideas that this show has allowed itself to begin to explore. Although I don't expect they'll go very far down that road.

I've complained about the use of slow mo in some other episodes. I didn't have any issue with it in this one. It felt way more natural for the scene and better done. Maybe that's because it wasn't as slow as the others have been. I don't know. But it was more enjoyable to watch and that's all I'm asking for.

Arondir's fight with the big boy was good. As were the shots of the Nooms riding across the Southlands (even if the timing was all a bit convenient, but again that's just TV writing).

I found it weird that Isildur was waiting to catch a glimpse of Middle Earth but then when the time came he was clearly looking directly at the rising sun. You can see [here](https://i.imgur.com/NMNECAH.png) that his eyeline is straight and then it cuts to [here](https://i.imgur.com/DibWn4T.png) where he's facing directly towards the sun. They even have it framed so that the land is off to the left in the shot. Why? Isildur has surely seen plenty of sunrises. Was there a miscommunication with the visual effects team here? Again, not a big issue just something that I noticed watching that momentarily took me out of the scene.

I also found it odd that Miriel told Isildur to go and he charged into the village alone. What was going on there? I guess she sensed that his horse was restless because he was restless? If we follow the logic that Elendil brought up later. It was odd though cos it felt like he was charging in to somehow save his dad but then he just didn't and didn't really do anything else of note. But I'm glad he got to do something cos I just know if he hadn't the next episode would be him crying about not getting to do anything. Maybe that's what Miriel was doing, sparing us that.

There's quite a few things that bothered me, but most of that was the kind of nonsense you see in every other show. It was characters doing stupid things for dramatic tension. Like no one even looking at the thing Adar was trying to escape with. But it wouldn't have made a difference if they had. I am amused by the idea that Galadriel did look and saw a little axe and just accepted that it has some significance. Like it's someone's favourite axe. I wouldn't even mark the episode down for this. It is, unfortunately, a reality of tv and movie writing. Only the very very best shows steer away from it and those are few.

Galadriel continues to be a character that I just cannot enjoy. I don't want to dislike her but it's the same smirk all the time. I don't believe it when her dialogue gets too tolkienian. When she said  ""Despise not the labour which humbles the heart"" it just felt forced to me. She doesn't normally speak that way so when she does it comes out of nowhere. Compare that to her next line ""Humility has saved entire kingdoms the proud have all but led to ruin"". This just sounds a lot more like the character. I'm not talking about the meaning but the sentence structure and the word order. People tend to be consistent in how they speak and when they pepper in little Tolkienisms they don't enhance the whole, they stick out as unnatural, imo. She should talk like that all the time or never. Pick a lane and be consistent.

Arondir is really starting to annoy me, but this is a me thing and I know the vast majority of people will have no issue with it. It's his accent. It's all over the place. Sometimes he sounds like an American doing a bad english accent. Sometimes he hits and it sounds English. Sometimes he even manages to sound like a Scandinavian doing a bad English accent. It takes me out of every scene he's in. I don't have any issue with him or the character other than that. And before some genius pipes up with ""It's a fantasy, England doesn't exist, hurr durr durr"" I know that. But a real accent is consistent. That's why people use real world accents in fantasy shows/films. If you take 100 hours of audio recording of me speaking you'll hear me say the same words in exactly the same way over and over again. He's not doing that and it grates. Miriel is the same, but she seems to have a little more control over it. Hers is bad in exactly the same way as Valkyrie in the MCU. Contrast these with Bronwyn. Her actress is putting on the accent, but she's doing it really well and it sounds consistent. I think that's the biggest reason I, a Scotsman, don't have a problem with Disa's accent so far. Does it sound cartoonish and silly? Sure. But it also sounds consistent. She's not all over the place with it. I can't help focusing on and hearing accents as I watch. Hopefully Arondir and Miriel get better. They're the only two at the moment that bother me.

I don't have a problem with the water causing the eruption. I did to begin with but then I learned what effect water has on lava and realised I was wrong. It was perhaps a bit overly apocalyptic, I mean specifically [this shot](https://i.imgur.com/OlWaOLJ.png). But it's not the worst thing in the world and maybe it's as justifiable a vision of what that would look like as what I have in my head. Either way it's a place where they can use artistic license and it is an impressive looking shot. All in all I'm actually a lot happier with how it happened than I imagined I would be. I hadn't made the connection that the key would release the water so I was really trying to imagine how you unlock a volcano. This was a lot better than what was in my head.

I wrote a lot about what I didn't like but all in all this episode was maybe my favourite so far.",20,45

(Episode [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/xrrbrm/comment/iqk1y17), [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/xlmuu5/bookfocused_discussion_megathread_for_the_rings/ipml09e/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/xfgxa1/bookfocused_discussion_megathread_for_the_rings/iootjkk/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/x9ngql/z/insnpfk), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/x3qfr2/z/imxwnsk), [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/x3qfr2/z/imt9yy8))

* Director: Brandstrom

* Writer: Cahill

* The Stranger healing the trees is an interesting inversion of Jesus cursing the fig tree. I'm not sure if the reference is intentional, and if so whether it should be considered an ill omen or a good one. Nori handing the apple to the Stranger also felt like an inversion of a more obvious biblical story.

* Elrond has learned (some) Khuzdul - I suspect that this was subsumed from Pengoloð (aka Sir Not Appearing in this TV Series) as the Dwarves were extremely reticent to teach any outsiders their language or even their right names.

* I took Elrond's words as more poetic than literal, but ""go towards goodness"" is not a very literal translation of *namárië*. It is more ""be good"" or ""be well"" (from *ná*, ""to be"" + *márië*, ""goodness, good"").

* So *mithril* is indeed magical in the show and capable of healing leaves - that much at least was not a lie fed to Celebrimbor and Gil-galad by Sauron, as speculated by many. Whether it is really necessary for the survival of the Elves remains to be seen, but I lean toward taking it at face value for now - I don't think the writers are engaging in nearly as many false leads and misdirects as some people seem to suspect. I wrote extensively about *mithril* after episode 5 so I won't spill much more ink here, but I do still think this storyline requires changes to not only the nature of *mithril* but the nature of Elves, the Trees, the Sun, the Moon, and the Silmarils. It's frankly a lot to swallow.

* It will be interesting to see where they go with Celeborn; if he is dead perhaps he will be sent back from Mandos in lieu of Glorfindel? If he is not dead, then clearly there is some sort of separation if not estrangement to be explained. Either way, this also leaves the door open for an adult Celebrian, which would be nice. I hadn't thought that possible as I don't think they could pull off having Celebrian born on the show. It would be too ""icky"" for audiences to see Elrond's future wife as a baby/young girl when he is already an adult, but if she is already full-grown and off with her dad somewhere it gives them the opportunity to introduce her to Elrond. This may be farther off in the weeds than they really intend to go, though.

* Míriel has become a favorite of mine on the show (I already found her interesting in the books, but her portrayal on the show has been strong). I particularly enjoyed her ""save your pity for our enemies"" speech in this episode. It is interesting that she refers to her father by his rarely-used (by Tolkien) Adunaic name (Ar-Inziladûn) while using her own Quenya name (her Adunaic name is Zimraphel). I wonder if she will take her father's role as the repentant ruler before the Fall.

* ""Our hearts even bigger than our feet"" was a line I strongly disliked in the trailers. It plays a little better here in context but it's still pretty cheesy.

* Pelargir already exists - glad to see that the Númenóreans have already colonized Middle-earth as they don't really have much time to set up colonies before the Drowning at this point.

* Dísa had quite the Lady Macbeth turn at the end of this episode. I had previously imagined that she might counsel against the digging that leads to awakening the Balrog; now I think she might end up being the one who pushes for it!

* The ""Southlands -&gt; Mordor"" graphic doesn't particularly bother me, but it does seem a little on-the-nose. I get the impression that someone involved in the production is concerned about the geography being difficult to understand - cf. just referring to Lindon and Eregion without specifying cities such as Mithlond and Ost-in-Edhil. Perhaps not a bad decision for the broader TV audience, if unnecessary for the diehard fans.",65,10
7,TRUE,It’s ironic that Miriel is now blind considering her father’s name means ‘farsighted’.,62,11
7,TRUE,"Okay, posted this on a few threads now. But after literal hours of research.

I am convinced that the stranger is Tillion the Maia, who was given the task of caring for the moon after the fall of the trees. 

He was in love with the Maia in charge of the sun: Arien and followed her through the night sky. When he occasionally caught up to her, his vessel became singed by her heat. (Point one: Explains him falling from the sky.) 

Morgoth sent three shadows of darkness after Tillion because he was the last reminders of the trees of Vallar. (Point two: explains the three guys after him atm.)

And!!!! He ends up refining his way back to Ilmen after defeating the three shadows of darkness. Ilmen is literally the meeting of the stars (Point three: this guy is after stars!) and is important because after the Númenórean disaster (the big wave) the elves follow these stars to get to the undying lands.

I have re read all 17 of my Tolkien note books… I’m convinced",60,12
7,TRUE,"I like how they literally spelled out for the audience that the Southlands is Mordor! If it was a mid episode establishing shot, sure, but as an end of episode stinger? Trust your audience.",53,13
7,TRUE,"I am very disapointed. 

Tolkien fans were worried about lore changes, invented characters and timeline comprenssion. Some decided to not even watch the show, some (like me) decided to watch it AND ENJOY it even if it's ""glorified fan fic"".

After all, it's a billon dollar show about the Second Age. The oportunities are huge, this could be the show of century if well done.

It isn't. I am still watching and I am not ""hating"" or saying this is garbage, I am more angry at the missed opportunity!",52,14
7,TRUE,"Ugh, this is terrible.

Overall the pacing and event-connection continue to be a complete wreck - they are constantly missing connective tissue dialogue and now the show is contradicting itself:

1. Theo suddenly appears in the camp and no one speaks to him? Oh, where's mom? Oh there she is!
2. Oh where's Halbrand? He's barely been mentioned. There he is! That wound, which ""needs Elvish medicine,"" seems suspicious. Oh great, he's back to being Sauron because this is a set-up to get him into Elflands. Screw this ridiculous toying with the viewer with really bad plot-twists.
3. Ok, I can buy Galadriel and Theo getting separated from everyone but they didn't try to help anyone? You showed us them walking off and then pan to a guy writhing in agony. This editing makes no sense unless you want the viewer to think Galadriel really is just heartless. I think this is just an amateurish mistake, not intentional.
4. Durin hasn't seen Elrond for 20 years before this show's events. He has gone from tentatively re-establishing friendship and ribbing his friend over this and that to crying like a baby because he can't help him. The tears were not earned by any actions we saw onscreen and while it's clear Durin is kind of a softie, he's not this soft, in my opinion. It makes the viewer want to side with his father, because he seems like a bit of a cry-baby. This is certainly not the intended effect.
5. Celeborn isn't confirmed to be dead (Galadriel didn't bury him like her brother), so this is an obvious set-up for a Galadriel rescue mission in season 2 or 3. They aren't going to break with LoTR.
6. Ok, so now there was a Numenorean colony at Pelagir? So how do you possibly write the last 6 episodes with no mention that the Numenoreans actually have been established in Middle Earth for some time? Stop with the stupid withholding of information for no good reason. What the hell is the actual Numenorean relationship with Middle Earth in this show?
7. As I predicted, Nori would leave the Bad Hair Train to help Meteor Bro. What makes absolutely no sense is that the Harfoots would suddenly decide to help him, again, because there's been no dialogue talking about the things that just happened. The Harfoots up to now have been isolationist and had good reason not to trust the guy, since every time he does something good, something bad happens too. What happens in this episode is the same thing again: he magically makes fruit grow, but then bad guys show up and burn it all. Why would their reaction to the Stranger be different this time? There's no establishing dialogue, no debate, no talking about what just happened. They just...change their minds. In a 79 minute runtime! C'mon!
8. Holy Elbereth, that ending was cheesy. The viewer gets this! Why do I get the feeling they're going to do a similar thing with Sauron when he's revealed lol...
9. Mithril Make Elves Merry is not a ruse. The way this is going to make the show worse in a million ways is beyond my ability to predict, but this is disastrous. I think they thought it just wouldn't be enough for Sauron to start tempting the elves as Annatar, so they created another plot/issue to make it possible. The Elves' not being able to get mithril is their plot turning point and will give them a reason to listen to Sauron.",49,15
7,TRUE,"Anyone else really put off with how Elendil reacted to Isildur's ""death"" this episode? I mean, obviously losing a child is terribly hard and he absolutely should grieve - but how he immediately blamed and hated Galadriel (and gave her a death stare), and then tried to sway the queen into leaving asap? It just felt extremely out of character and unprofessional to me, because he took his son to war and knew it was dangerous, and he's a long time military man who should've been able to stay focused and objective despite his grief.",45,16
7,TRUE,"So if Mithril shines the light of the Silmarils why THE FUCK is the Balrog hibernating in the middle of a giant vein of it?
Did these writers not read the Silmarilion to miss what effect Silmarils have on evil creatures?",48,17
7,TRUE,Why are all the characters so fucking dumb?,46,18
7,TRUE,So looks like Celeborn returning may help in bringing back Galadriels 'light'. Either that or he has actually died and the show is going severely off the trail.,41,19
7,TRUE,"I bet the Celeborn decision was made purely to allow a Galadriel/Halbrand romance. Celeborn - not dead, just missing- can show up at a particularly dramatic moment and create a love triangle. 

I heard fans loved it when they did that in the Hobbit.",39,20
7,TRUE,"What the fuck is this show? Seriously what am I watching? Ok so it’s a complete departure from the lore…fine. But on its own, what story is being told here? Is there even a theme? How is it people can write something this expensive and have a job? Again WTF is this?",43,21
7,TRUE,"I think it would've been more interesting if Halbrand had just disappeared during this episode and next week Annatar appears. Although we haven't seen next week yet so whatever they do with it might be more interesting. 

Also did i miss something or was Isildur just left behind? He obviously isn't dead but if he was left he's now in the middle of hostile territory by himself with no idea where anyone friendly is. 

Will be interesting to see how it ends but I'm really not looking forward to the 20 second scene of Sauron at the end of the episode to be all we get of him.",36,22
7,TRUE,"It's excusable for a penultimate episode to slow down a bit to put the pieces in place for the finale. But, the Harfoots suddenly declaring they're a big family after leaving behind their own and sending away a stranger, as well as the most unnecessary Mordor text change... I just love being force fed writing that doesn't respect its audience.

It literally would've been much better to have the orcs chant ""Mordor"" as an answer to Adar's question instead of putting text on my screen",36,23
7,TRUE,"People are having lots of criticisms here, all justified. But I just don’t understand how none of the characters awaking in the ash even have singed hair or burned clothes? Fiery volcano clouds are pretty hot. I can totally suspend my disbelief for characters surviving it, that’s fine, but not actual fire damage? Not even to their hair? I burned some hair off with my blow dryer once.",39,24
7,TRUE,"So, let me be clear, this kingdom of Southlands is actually named Southlands.

And consists of one village with maybe 50 people at tops?

This show nears runtime of Jackson trilogy and this what they can give?",34,25
7,TRUE,"I saw a spoiler before watching that some people were upset that the show killed off Celeborn and now having watched it, I have to ask. Has everyone who's angry about this read any book or watched any movie ever? Like is this the very first story you've ever encountered? There has never been a more obviously alive ""dead"" character. Do you also think Isildur is done for? Cause I got news on that one too.",39,26
7,TRUE,"  
There doesn't seem to be any satisfying explanation for where Celeborn could be in the millennnia since the War of Wrath. Sauron or anyone else wouldn't waste his time holding him that long. Not sure where this is going.  
  
What happened to Miriel is also fairly lore breaking, unless she's cured, as literally one of the last things in the Silmarillion is climb up a mountain she can obviously see",34,27
7,TRUE,"now that the mithril seems to be confirmed as truth I can't help but think that the writers don't understand the Elfs (or don't expect the audience to, which would be even worse), their perception of time or the very fact that they are inmortal and the effect this has on the races around them. and they've come up with this story line to strip them of their inmortality and introduce a fake sense of urgency their race largely lacks so they are more ""relatable"" and on par with the rest of the characters.",36,28
7,TRUE,"Yeah.. I think I’m done.
This atrocious writing is fucking ridiculous.
The awful dialogue; the characters even contradict themselves every chance they get.

Also Harfoots, I hate them so much. At first they all for leaving people behind, even sabotage. One mistake the stranger makes and he gets banished, even after saving them from the wolves. Now they are preaching how they take care of themselves and whatnot? What? 

Again the pacing, 1 hour of this bs for hardly any plot, character progression.
Every scene feels disjointed, nothing feels right. Artificial, no emotional weight(I literally don’t care about anyone except Durin and Elrond).

The music keeps blasting away every damn scene!

I just don’t care about this world they are trying to build. 
I will watch the finale, but probably won’t come back for season 2 unless they drastically change EVERYTHING.",36,29
7,TRUE,"Everyone in knots that Celeborn is ""dead"" just needs to use some sense for a moment. Amazon is expecting to produce at least five seasons, and Galadriel is our main character. Are we going to change established canon and kill her husband OR are we going to tell an untold story that reuintes them? She said herself she never saw him again. Chill out.",31,30
7,TRUE,"Why is everyone alive after a lava flow? 

Why are galadriel and Theo the only two not able to find the whole group to escape from the lava flow they should have all died from? 

Why is the queen the only one who faces any consequences from said flow? 

Why is Bronwyn still in a spaghetti strap? 

Why is no one burned or coughing lungs up after said lava?

Why is gandalf wannabe trying to kill the hobbits so much? 

Why is Theo still alive or a character? 

Why is celeborn dead? 

Why is galadriel suddenly luthien? 

Celeborn didn't have armour that fit him when he's a fucking high lord of the elves?

Why does Nori send the cultists after wannabe gandalf when she thinks he's good and wants to protect him? Why even jump out of the bushes.in the first place when they clearly were headed somewhere else?

Why is halbrand walking or hiking after being not able to do either two seconds before?

The balrog woke up because of a leaf?",32,31
7,TRUE,"I think I came into this show with a good open mind. I had my anxiousness and doubts but I'm also old enough to remember the backlash against the PJ trilogy from book fans, and despite my own minor problems with those adaptations can enjoy them as they are.

This show has entirely lost me. I believe it has failed not only as an adaptation of Tolkien's works, but more generally as a story. I hated this episode so much, from the fact that everyone just survived direct exposure to pyroclastic flow to the ludicrous fact that mithril is confirmed to be the result of a fight between an elf and a balrog and a tree that got struck by lighting and also contains the light of the silmarils. I am not alone in disliking Galadriel's character, and despite the fact that she is now showing some signs of growth, we had to suffer through 6 episodes of one of the top characters being obstinate, single minded, and unlikable. No Numenorian is impressive to me, not even Elendil who is probably the best portrayal of one. Then there are just some choices they make, like the name reveal of Mordor, that just make me roll my eyes and groan. There's so much more but most of it is detailed already in this thread, so not worth rehashing all of it.

It's all good though, we always have the books and I've been itching to listen to Christopher Lee's audiobook of the Children of Hurin. I'll do that as a palette cleanser next weekend after this mess is behind us.",29,32
7,TRUE,I think I'm checked out. I'll still watch but idk if I'll come back for season 2,34,33
7,TRUE,"Like somebody else mentioned... how is everyone alive? This was just another extra long episode of dialogue going nowhere. What was the point of chasing discount Gandalf away just to chase after him right after? What was the point of all that back and forth with Durin and Elrond if the plot, after 112 minutes was going to stay the same? If you breakdown all the episodes so far to their highlights and compare it to any of the other LOTR movies it still wouldn't have the same impact. What a convoluted mess.",29,34
7,TRUE,Don't know how they all survived the opening. Takes you out of it. And I don't get why the harfoots are acting like the stranger was so dangerous and were scared of him. They only got hurt by not leaving him alone when doing magic,30,35
7,TRUE,"Where is the quality control?  Every scene is a hollow, soulless member-berry to actual art and something with substance. The watchtower instantly fell to bits...whyy??? Mount Doom has an on-switch, Arondirs speech to the southlanders, Galadriel and Theo hiding from the Orcs, Galadriel doing the 180 and telling Theo to not wish for death and destruction, The damn Harfoots not doing anything for 7 episodes, the ugly cgi Balrog roaring into the screen because a leaf landed in its cave, THE MITHRIL PLOT!!!, all of the fake deaths within two episodes, Isildurs horse doing an Aragorn and Brego, THE KING OF THE SOUTHLANDS!!!. THE META POWERPOINT LOGO. Why?",32,36
7,TRUE,"This episode was the most mixed for me for sure. 

I disliked:

- The Mithril subplot being more or less confirmed as truth. I was really hoping it was a trick, but the scene with the leaf certainly seems to imply that it is healing whatever is causing that sickness.

- Things left unexplained for no reason. Why did Galadriel and Theo just abandon everyone else in town? Who knows, who cares. How are they and they alone separated from the massive group of people when they all start in the same place? Don't worry about it.

- Extremely tacky ending. That seriously could have been done a dozen different ways that wouldn't have been nearly as tacky as what they did. It just seemed so pointless.

- Celeborn. I mean I suspect he's not dead or gone, but its a major question mark now and with the Mithril change I'm apprehensive at this point. If it hadn't been for some other decisions I may not feel as weird about it, but until I see more I'm going to be a little wary.

This I liked:

- I know they are divisive, but I like the Harfoot story. I liked that they have gone through a process of not knowing what to make of the situation because they shouldn't really. The Stranger does things that are terrible and amazing. I like Saddoc as a pessimistic halfing trying to keep to tradition without completely exiling them. I like that they are not perfect. And I like that they are slowly building up goodness over time.

- Galadriel's growth. I thought Galadriel and Theo worked a lot better than I thought it would have. Galadriel obviously saw a lot of herself in what Theo was saying and between that and her quest ending this catastrophically we got to see her start to come to terms with how much her obsession has cost her.

- Durin and Elrond continue to be great. Just everything about them. Elrond telling Durin he threw the match and leaving it ambiguous whether he is pushing Durin's buttons or not, the emotion between all of the characters from Durin/Durin to Durin/Disa to Durin/Elrond all of them are just great. Despite the whole Mithril subplot being a bit off for me the dwarves have been terrific.

All in all I think the episode made me question the direction it is going the most. I think when I rewatch Season 1 it will end up being a little lower rated in my opinion than I thought it would be, but I don't think my enjoyment of the show is ruined either.

Still looking forward to next week's finale, just a little more apprehensively now.",32,37
7,TRUE,"I'll finish out the first season out of pure stubbornness.  What's really eating me is the complete jumbling of the timeline.  This story takes place after II 3255 (death of Tar-Palantir).  They make it seem like mithril was just being discovered, but mithril was known in Numenor as early as the reign of Tar-Telemmaitë (15th King of Numenor - II 2386 to II 2526). And Durin's Bane wasn't awaken until III 1980.

Mordor was occupied by Sauron in II 1000 and Sauron forged the One Ring around II 1600.  In fact, all the rings of power had been forged by II 1600.  Here's the biggest timeline blunder: Lord Celebrimbor was slain in II 1697.  So how the hell is he here wanting help from the Dwarves to build forges?

I choose to ignore the ""elves need mithril to live"" plotline.  That's just plain ridiculous.",29,38
7,TRUE,"After the cultist set fire to the Harfoots settlements, they just leave? Nothing after that? They don’t kill the Harfoots or take any of them? What happened?

7,TRUE,"It's admittedly been a long time since I've read the books, although I did recently restart Lord of the Rings, not very far into it yet, and I know this show toys with lore in extreme ways, but I can't help but feel like it is immensely enjoyable. I enjoy the vast majority of the characters, the show looks amazing, the score is amazing, it's just a solid hour of entertainment that almost makes me feel uplifted each week.

I'm very okay treating this as a what-if sort of story, which to be fair the showrunners have been pretty open about that is what it is since the beginning.

I'm a social worker, and by the end of every work week, I'm beyond tired and exhausted with some of the crap I'm dealing with, it's nice to come home to a show that has clearly defined good and evil, is uplifting, and usually focuses on more positive stuff.

I enjoy almost everything about the show, And I'm looking forward to the finale and four more seasons after this.",26,45
7,TRUE,"I posted this in the No Book Spoiler thread but I'll post it here as well:

A note on Galadriel's rage and a kind of explanation on her character arc.  
  
Simply put. Galadriel has lost it all.  
  
She had three brothers. All of them dead in the wars against Melkor and Sauron.  
  
""Angrod was the elder brother of Aegnor and Galadriel, and the younger brother of Finrod Felagund. Together with Aegnor he held the highlands of Dorthonion against Morgoth. Angrod and Aegnor were both slain in the Dagor Bragollach (""Battle of Sudden Flame"").""  
  
Finrod was imprisoned by Sauron himself and killed by a werewolf.  
  
She saw the two trees die (literally the light of the creation died) she saw Melkor taking the Silmarils from Feanor and killing his father, Finwë, the first High King of the Noldor who led his people on the journey from Middle earth to Valinor.  
  
She experienced the madness of Feanors Oath. The kinslayings. The burning of the boats. She crossed the Helcaraxe where a lot of elves died. She experienced all the wars in all the ages. She witnessed the full downfall of Feanors sons and the fall of the Noldor.  
  
And if the show writes out Celeborn. Well add that to the list. Galadriels behaviour is something you'd expect - why wouldn't she be blinded by rage and grief against the horror that has without pause acted against all that is good during ALL the ages. Why would she go back to Valinor - there is nothing left there for her.  
  
Yet in this episode she saw the light, or rather the folly of her ways, because she was LITERALLY touched by darkness just like Finrod said. The writers have put some thoughts into this - it is noticeable. However, dialogue choices and maybe at times acting performance, is somewhat lacking.  
  
I mean the episode literally starts with Galadriel opening her eyes. Hence the name of the episode ""The Eye"". It's not Saurons eye. It's Galadriel assessing the situation clearly for the first time. She can now become Galadriel the Wise.  
  
Of course this isn't as Tolkien wrote it, but to be honest a pretty good rendition of this character. I like it.",25,46
7,TRUE,If the show's quality falls any further they're gonna awake a balrog,20,47
7,TRUE,"So we see ""Eminem"" again, clearly a ~~bad guy~~  (Edit - bad gal). Poor Harfoots.

The queen being blind now, probably sets the stage for Pharazon to usurp her.

I feel that the show doesn't get the distances involved. Halbrand,seriously wounded, is expected to survive a journey from Southlands/Mordor to Lindon? Isn't it thousands of miles away?

Also, isn't several thousand years before the Balrog should be woken? Unless they just meant it as a easter egg.",20,48
7,TRUE,Um...why is Celeborn dead?  That's not a minor lore change.  That's a massive departure that has ramifications through the entire LotR series.  Who is cross checking the lore here?,23,49
7,TRUE,"I’m not that familiar with lotr, I thought durins bane occurred in the 3rd age not where we are now? Thought I’d ask here as I don’t want to spoil too much by reading wiki",17,50

8,TRUE,"“Call it a gift”

8,TRUE,Galadriel doesn’t tell them she just found out who Sauron is and randomly commissions some mithril rings that they literally just learned exactly how to make from Sauron. Like how did he not have a hand in them??!,74,3
8,TRUE,"I have to say, this episode definitely cements Rings of Power as absolutely one of the shows of all time!",66,4
8,TRUE,"""Hey guys, Sauron just revealed his identity to me but whatever let's forge some rings!""",68,5
8,TRUE,"I'm not going to comment on the ""big surprises"" being exactly what everyone predicted in episode 2.  I'm not even going to comment on Galadriel's character being further assassinated.  I'm only going to comment about the lore, once again, being completely mishandled.

The Elven rings were supposed to be forged LAST.  They were forged by Celebrimbor alone.  But before he did that, Annatar (or in the show Halbrand) first 'corrupted' the smith by promising them works that would rival the works of the elves in Valinor.  I'll give the show a moment of consideration and say that we can use the plot of save the elves for the forging of the rings.  They first forged prototype rings WITH Annatar's direct help and these were the rings that were given to the Dwarves and Men.  It wasn't until after Annatar left that Celebrimbor went on to forge the Elven rings, which is why Sauron had less power of them.

So if the Elven rings are already forged, and Halbrand has been revealed and left...where/why are the other rings going to be forged?  If Sauron takes on a new form and comes back, why is Celebrimbor going to forge rings with him?  He's already accomplished the show's plot of saving the Elves.  Will Sauron forge the rings himself?  That completely changes the idea of how it was so insidious that he got them out to the other races.  The only way the show could pull off Sauron forging it himself would be to go a route of ""looks at the power the Elves have and won't share.  But here, I can help you.""  Which might work for the Dwarves, but it would undercut the alliance of men and elves that eventually defeats Sauron.

For a show that is titled and supposed to be all about the Rings of Power.  You'd think they would have done their homework and planned the story of the rings better.",60,6
8,TRUE,Man I fucking can’t with the harfoots it’s so damn boring and I literally don’t care why did they drag this shit on for so long,52,7
8,TRUE,"What the heck was up with Elrond forgetting his own brother Elros when speaking with Galadriel about how they met?

Orphaned...with no friends or **KIN!** YOU LIED ELROND. YOU DAMN LIED!",56,8
8,TRUE,You knew how this episode was gonna go when Galadriel made it from Mordor to Eregion with a mortally wounded guy in “six days ride.” I looked it up after and it took Boromir 110 days to reach Rivendell solo. I know it’s nitpicky but this is just like one thing I’d like to bring attention to because the rest of this episode hurts my brain.,50,9
8,TRUE,"Why the hell didn't Celebrimbor and Elrond ask for details when Galadriel told them never to trust Halbrand again? Anyone would've been following up with questions like ""Why, what did he do?""

Hasn't the whole ring making lore been tossed out a window, even the ones in PJ's movies? PJ's films had enough mithril to make at least a shirt AND the doors of Durin of Moria were built with elves. Thus, at some point Moria would be friendly with elves and probably give them some mithril. Couldn't the elves just throw away or destroy the elven rings then since according to ROP they only need the mithril? Don't tell me Sauron has power over all mithril too now, albeit I concede his one ring would have power over the three because he learned Celebrimbor's forging details or something.

How the hell are the 7 and the 9 going to be made now? Sauron makes them on his own? Wouldn't the elves tell everyone not to accept them? Maybe the dwarves will ignore this because of the mithril feud but I'm not sure the humans would.

Meteor Man's obviously Gandalf but I still think making him Saruman would be a good twist.  Have no idea why the Valar sent him on a meteor unless they wanted to draw out Sauron's followers.

If it were really easy to find that the Southlands had no royal line active in a thousand years, why wouldn't Arondir, who's entire job is, you know, to be an expert on the Southlands for the past 70+ years, not have pointed this out the moment Halbrand was named king?",52,10
8,TRUE,"Since Galadriel just tried to help save the Southlands from Sauron, surely she's going to send some messages down to Arondir and Bronwyn to let them know that like...Hey! Your king is actually kind of Sauron. Or send messages to Numenor because they also helped install ""Halbrand"" as king. We can't just drop that and pretend it didn't happen, right?",49,11
8,TRUE,What the hell was that take on the end credits song. Fergie singing the national anthem vibes,48,12

8,TRUE,"Something that makes Tolkien's work what it is, is his way of answering questions in a way that only deepens the mystery and wonder of his world. The writers need to learn this  and I feel like the biggest problem was that they over explained the process around forging the rings. Why not have halbrand change appearance to Annatar and inspire Celebrimbor that way, instead of him giving some crude dialog around what an alloy is. When Galadriel said that they should make three for balance I basically vomited. 

The three rings now feel like a half baked assignment that was started 3 hours before the due date, instead of the mystical and mysterious things the books create. I'm sad",41,16
8,TRUE,"Fantasy: the TV series, but with Tolkien names and places plastered all over. I fail to see any elements of the source material or to recognize any character at all. The writing was so ridiculous that I busted out laughing at least once per episode. I'm glad this is over at least.",38,17

8,TRUE,"No Durin, Arondir, Isildur, or Adar? Really?",34,19
8,TRUE,"Well, that was way way way worse than I could have ever expected.

This show is obsessed with fake outs. Sauron fake outs are over, now its time to totally pretend this blue wizard is Gandalf when he def isn't.",36,20
8,TRUE,"Galadriel is unwise, Gil Galad is a conspiracy theorist, Celebrimbor doesn't know Forging and Alloying, Sauron loves Galadriel, Harfoots are way too dragged and Gandalf is going to get ruined. GREAT, what a show, I waited and hoped till the last half hour, but after ""Call it a gift"" and seeing constant Celebrimbor nonsense: I gave up.

Fück you Amazon",36,21
8,TRUE,"For me, while I enjoyed the episode ok overall, it kind of highlights even more the pacing issues of this season. We wasted 25% of the season (episodes 5 and 7) doing nothing and then crammed way too much into the last episode. Also people shit on the latter seasons of GOT for teleporting characters all over the place but this show takes it to a whole other level lol Halbrand went from Mordor to the forge and all the way back to Mordor again in less than one episode",37,22
8,TRUE,Hey Gandalf do you want to watch rings of power season 2? “I’m Good!”,36,23
8,TRUE,"So what exactly was Saurons plan? Bump into Galadriel at Sea randomly, get picked up by numenoreans randomly witness mt doom explode, get speared but not enough to die so that the elves can heal you after aa 600 mile ride and then in 2 days teach celebrimbor master smith of the elves basics of smithing and create the elvish rings so that he can create his aand control them? Did i get that right?

My mans a genius.",33,24
8,TRUE,I guess Galadriel is officially the stupidest character in the whole show. Nice just as Tolkien intended.,32,25

8,TRUE,Book focused? What books did they use?,30,27
8,TRUE,"God. Imagine what could have been done with all that money?

Peter Jackson, with 1/100th the budget, made more believable costumes, props, and sets. 

Fuck this fucking show. Everything Amazon touches turns to shit",32,28
8,TRUE,"I would have preferred a season which told us Annatar deceived Celebrimbor with gifts, to Galadriel-Halbrand scenes.  
Unfortunately, the lack of time concept throughout the 7 episodes caused them to speed up in the final episode. Although it is a ""7-episode mystery series"" consisting of Hollywood scenarios and far from the Tolkien universe, it was nice that they answered some questions at the end.  
Am I excited for next season? Definitely no.",30,29
8,TRUE,My word the pacing is just terrible. They basically do nothing all season long and then they rush the Halbrand is really Annatar who is really Sauron. He just wakes up and immediately starts smithing/teaching Celebrimbor and everyone accepts it for reasons.,28,30
8,TRUE,"This season was just a prolonged character assassination of Galadriel. They not only made her reckless and idiotically selfish, but they also made her the cause of so much evil being able to survive.

I know Christian themes play a major part in Tolkien's writing, but did they really have to go so heavy handed with a selfish-unwise-woman-sins-and-allows-powerful-evil-to-flourish? I fear now they will make her even more at fault by not sharing her discovery or even pushing a romantic angle with freaking Sauron!

The show's Galadriel is so far away from the complex powerful character I admired in Tolkien's world.",27,31
8,TRUE,Final thoughts on the whole season: Prologue was cool.,28,32
8,TRUE,How can they think this is acceptable story telling? How can they butcher the lore this much?,28,33
8,TRUE,Why did Galadriel have to suggest the elven rings? It would've been more interesting if it happened as in the lore,22,34
8,TRUE,"Good job of the show/producers to fire the Tolkien historian, totally didn’t need his expertise and also denying Peter Jackson from giving script notes for the show, yup genius.  The show seems intent on cramming in every character even if they are 5000 years too early. So much potential, wasted.",27,35
8,TRUE,Celebrimbor &amp; Hauron kinda forgot to make the seven and the nine rings.,23,36
8,TRUE,The Tolkien Estate had such harsh criticisms of the PJ movies and they are okay with this many changes? So many strange decisions that don’t make sense.,23,37
8,TRUE,Prime has ruined LOTR and Thursday Night Football!,28,38
8,TRUE,My disappointment is immeasurable; and my day is ruined.,22,39
8,TRUE,This show reminds me of hiring writers who only read the cliff notes of the source material,22,40

Quick thoughts on Episode 8

(Episode [7](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/xxoyqz/bookfocused_discussion_megathread_for_the_rings/irf68xv/), [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/xrrbrm/comment/iqk1y17), [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/xlmuu5/bookfocused_discussion_megathread_for_the_rings/ipml09e/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/xfgxa1/bookfocused_discussion_megathread_for_the_rings/iootjkk/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/x9ngql/z/insnpfk), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/x3qfr2/z/imxwnsk), [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/x3qfr2/z/imt9yy8))

* Director: Yip

* Writers: Hutchinson, Payne, McKay

* I was on the H = S train for a number of reasons, so I can't say I was shocked by the reveal. 

* One thing I've come to learn about this show is that it is intended to be accessible to all kinds of viewers. Theories that Annatar was in Eregion influencing things behind the scenes, or that *mithril* and the Elves fading was a deception by Sauron, might make sense to those of us who have read the stories, but they would be bizarre twists with no foreshadowing to someone who hasn't. In other words, this show is playing it much straighter than all the theorists think or want. For much the same reason, I think the clues pointing to the Stranger being Gandalf (his relationship to halflings, ""follow your nose,"" the Hermit's Hat constellation, the moths recalling the PJ movies) probably just mean he's Gandalf. As another example of making the show accessible, they made it explicit that *istar* means ""wizard."" I said all the way back after episode 2 that making the Stranger a Blue Wizard would be ""too deep of a cut"" for the show, and I stand by that. Gandalf is popular, Gandalf is well-known, the Stranger is Gandalf.

* I was surprised that the cultists just blew up already. Thought they'd be around longer. Hopefully we'll get an explanation of who they were. I think one of them made a sound similar to the Nazgûl from the movies at one point, but of course they can't be Nazgûl (unless Sauron already forged the nine).

* Is Elrond giving up? He tells Celebrimbor they should ""prepare to abandon these shores."" But then says to Galadriel two minutes later: ""I should never have set you on that ship."" I was glad to see him apologize for his part in driving her away at least.

* Halbrand refers to ""the master I apprenticed to"" spoke of Celebrimbor's work - most likely Morgoth, then. Mairon studied under Aulë, but that was before Celebrimbor existed.

* Pharazôn speaks of immortality for the first time! ""It will be our duty to forge for him a tomb, granting him the immortality in stone that no man, not even a king, can attain in life."" This was a brief moment but a highlight of the episode for me, as it is the first moment we get a hint that the Númenóreans are not just anti-Elf but motivated by the fear of their own mortality. However, I still find it very uncharacteristic for Tar-Palantir to die in such a way (see my notes from episode 4).

* Interesting to see Galadriel and Elrond encouraging/supporting forging *something* while Gil-galad casts doubt. I am glad to see Gil-galad being a good guy for once instead of lying his ass off at every turn. And Elrond goes on to participate in the work with Sauron. Hmm.

* The deadline of the ""Great Tree"" leaves falling feels very artificial to me. It's like the Elves are collectively the Beast from *Beauty and the Beast*. This tends to be an annoyance with TV and movies in general, but I don't like the tendency to set these hard time limits because 99.9% of the time we know the solution is going to come at the last minute anyway. The bomb always gets defused with 1 second left.

* Really wish Galadriel would say something. Yes, I understand that pride is a major flaw in her character and that she is avoiding the shame that would come from admitting she brought Sauron into the heart of elvendom in Middle-earth and then let him walk away. But the way she handled this leads to leaving the door open for Halbrand to come back and work with Celebrimbor again (unlike Elrond he never promised to trust her). This could prove to be a big mistake.

* Forging the Three first, rather than last after Sauron's deceit had become known, is a pretty massive reversal.

* ""He is the other. The Istar"" - I speculated earlier that perhaps the Stranger (Gandalf, clearly now) might have arrived in meteor due to a previous battle with Sauron that erased his memory. ""He is the other"" makes me think it's very possible that he did indeed have a confrontation of some sort to Sauron prior to the show (perhaps they fought each other in the War of Wrath).

* I am hopeful that Míriel does stay Faithful after she says, ""My father once told me that the way of The Faithful is committing to pay the price.""

* Sauron's elevator pitch to Galadriel clearly references her much later speech: ""stronger than the foundations of the earth."" And I think they applies a very similar vocal effect to Morfydd Clark's voice at the end of this scene as Peter Jackson used on Cate Blanchett during that speech.

* It's interesting to have Fiona Apple sing the whole ring verse in the end credits when 85% of the rings haven't been forged yet.

In many ways I thought this was a well-done episode. Like many others, I was surprised at how quickly they blew threw the whole ""Annatar"" part of the plot; I certainly wasn't expecting the Three to be made so soon. I do wonder if Halbrand will be back in Eregion helping Celebrimbor make the Seven and the Nine, if he'll make them by himself in Mt Doom, or if he already has them in that pouch of his. And I can already see that the ""Gandalf vs Blue Wizard"" debate on the Stranger's identity is going to rage on until at least the next season (two years?) - the showrunners, it seems, do not have a magic tree shedding leaves to put them on a deadline. At this point I think the show has departed so much from the book-story that all bets are off as to how things progress, aside from the really huge events (the Ruling Ring, the fall of Númenor, and the Last Alliance). I'm considering writing a whole-season review that's a bit more structured than these off-the-cuff thoughts.",23,42
8,TRUE,Who is shittier at their job: Manwe as King or Celebrimbor as a smith? He’s Feanor’s grandson and he didn’t know about alloys?!?!?!,19,43
8,TRUE,"Why is Celebrimbor even talking to this dude lmao. ""Amplify"" bro we need more mithril, don't talk to me about fucking alloys.",19,44
8,TRUE,"Durin didn't make an appearance in the finale? The Balrog woke up, roared once, and said, ""I'll wait a few months for season 2.""",20,45
8,TRUE,"Its not even a question of lore accuracy to me. I understood that with the limited material available to them (The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings + appendices) that they would have to deviate some. Am I disappointed with the amount of deviation? Absolutely. I think the amount of original characters and plotlines has led the show to feel like a generic fantasy project with some Tolkien names splashed in.

The problem, for me, is that the show fails even as a generic fantasy show. The pacing is horrendous. It has multiple plotlines, each moving at completely separate speeds, and that's not saying anything about the last two episodes. The characters are another massive issue. Who am I supposed to root for? Nobody in this show is even remotely likeable except Durin IV and Elrond. But Elrond doesn't even feel like Elrond, honestly. The characters also have some of the worst and out of left field decision-making of all time, which has really been made more apparent in the final two episodes. The amount of contrivances and characters suddenly losing 150 IQ points just to have the story move forward is ridiculous.

On top of that, this is a show playing around in an established universe with well-known lore (this is a problem I also found with *Obi-Wan Kenobi*, but is something dealt with in making any prequel). Things like the Isildur death fake out do not work. We know he's okay, just like we knew the Grand Inquisitor would survive *Obi-Wan Kenobi*. Don't dick around with obvious fake outs when the character is already established to have lived past this. Try a fake out death on Bronwyn, Theo, Arondir, etc. Somebody you've made up and who would have actual stakes. Of course, this still only works if you are invested in the characters, but its still better than trying to make me think Isildur is dead.

Spectacle over substance.",20,46
8,TRUE,"How does Amazon think they get away with this shit? Changing Annatar to Halbrand? Bringing any of the istari to ME in the second age? 

Like how do you justify changing the lore in these ways.",20,47
8,TRUE,"Wtf happened to the other rings?!! I always thought Sauron helped create all the rings with the elves, imbedding them with his power secretly in order to control them. Then creating the one ring, which alerts the elves of his ass. Makes no sense to not have them make the other rings especially with that awful song in the end credits literally explaining it all. Wtf are they doing",18,48
8,TRUE,"I have such mixed feelings about this show.

The good:

* Acting is good to great. Some actors also had great chemistry together (Elrond/Durin/Disa in particular).
* Music was great too
* The visuals were amazing, particularly the shots of the first age, moria and numenor were so well done.
* There were a lot of little moments that felt ""just right"".

The bad:

* The overall plot falls flat for me. I feel like there are a lot of weak plot devices introduced just to make the overall plot move forward. Of the top of my head I can think of:
  * Suddenly all the elves will die in a few months for no real reason
  * Mithril is the magical cure for all these problems... Somehow
  * Gil-galad can send people to valinor
  * Galadriels dagger is the only item in this whole area with the materials we need for this ring, because we need this to be a big moment for her!
* I get that you want to draw parallels to the books / movies, but I feel like they're beating us over the head too much with it. I particularly did not like the galadriel scene which mirrors the scene when frodo offers her the ring.
* Wizard battles are not tolkien to me.

My opinion of this show has shifted surprisingly little since the first episode. You can see that money and effort were just poured into this, but all of this is hamstrung by overall plot decisions that just feel weird. I'll probably watch the next season, but I hope the writing improves. That being said, I had a similar feeling about the witcher (great acting / visuals / ..., weak writing) and that just got worse in the second season.",20,49
8,TRUE,"I *really* hated the cultist subplot going on here, but personally I’ve been rooting for Halbrand to be the Annatar stand in since episode 1, so I’m here for it.

Sloppy execution overall, but great execution on like 4 or 5 things that I enjoyed. So, I dunno, maybe I’d give it a 6.5/10? As much as I was frustrated by this season, I’ll be here with the rest of you in two years or however long I’m sure.",16,50

I have zero complaints, nor would I change anything about it.",45,3
2,FALSE,"I really enjoyed it. 

Visually it felt like middle earth to me. The music is sublime, but I expected nothing else from Bear. The way people talk and frame sentences felt to be very much like middle earth. Is the story great? To early to tell. Good at least IMO.

No adaptation is ever perfect. Things are changed to fit the age and medium and some things get lost in translation. That's fine. I don't care. 
I was drawn into it, just like I was the books and the movies.  9/10 so far for me, but I'm an optimist",46,4
2,FALSE,"Just got through episode 1 and wow, so far I absolutely love it! Really captures the Middle Earth feeling, with amazing production and solid performances so far. 

It's different to Lord of the Rings, but in a way that I can get used to and immersed in. For context, I hated the Hobbit movies (even if I rewatch for love of the book and some great moments). 

All I say is watch it. If there's any complaint I have so far, it's that the music is nowhere as impactful or memorable as Howard Shore's scores, but that is a really high benchmark to live up to. 

Episode 1 was a great gateway, I'm sold and hooked for the next.",30,5
2,FALSE,This show is a good reason why I invested in a big OLED tv a while ago. It's gorgeous! From the get go you can see it was made by talented artists.,31,6
2,FALSE,"It's a very good show! All the haters were WRONG. I went expecting something terrible, but got something worthy, with some great scenes, and overall good quality. The music could have been better(which is very sad), nothing memorable but also nothing bad either; the characters are mostly interesting and well-made; the visual aspects are perfect; the plot is not that fast but it's not a great issue either; Galadriel was depicted by Tolkien as a warrior in her youth so it makes sense even if I don't quite like it(seems out of character with the one we know of the film), so it's not something I enjoy and the thing I disliked the most but it's not terrible either; the ambience was very well done as well and there are some pretty good actors. 8.5/10",29,7

It’s great so far.",25,9
2,FALSE,[deleted],25,10

It's more enjoyable than GOT S8 and IMO Wheel of Time.",25,11
2,FALSE,"Positively surprised how well the world is looking. The scenes, the dialect and the characters feel like ME to me. Unlike the Hobbit movies, it feels much more grounded where it is supposed to and radiant when supposed to. Not perfect of course, but nothing ever is. Not even the PJ films were _perfect_. But so far so good. Looking forward to get to know these characters and to see what will happen to them.",26,12
2,FALSE,I actually LOVED the way they had exposition in the first episode.  The first 15 minutes had me smiling.  Then we got into the actual stories that we will be following and I love the characters so far.  10/10 for me honestly,22,13
2,FALSE,"So I am like a die hard LOTR Original Trilogy fan and really thought I was going to hate this. 

I actually really loved it. It doesn’t have the heart of the original series (that would be difficult narratively, with all the disparate storylines) but it is beautiful, fun, and I’m interested to see where all the plotlines go.

2,FALSE,"I thought it was wayyy better than I feared, definitely above the Hobbit so far. I can't wait for Sauron to steal the show!",19,15
2,FALSE,"I have to say, I absolutely love it. I’d advise people not to watch it via the lens of being a “Tolkien purist”, just enjoy it for what it is. 


Khazad-Dum and the dwarves were the high point for me. It was exactly as I had pictured Khazad-Dum, and the score was exceptional. Disa stole I absolutely loved her dynamic with Durin, and I though the bit about the tree growing in a place full of love was a beautiful little moment. It was an interesting concept to explore the friendship between Elrond and Durin, when time practically means nothing to one of them. 

There were a few things I didn’t love. I like the heart and togetherness of the Harfoot’s, but I couldn’t help but feel the stakes were higher elsewhere, and the pacing suffered a bit for lingering with them.

2,FALSE,I loved the first two episodes. My only experiences with Middle Earth are reading The Hobbit and LotR and watching the LotR extended trilogy a million times. I don't know much lots outside of that and I'm really happy with the show. It captured the magic for me,15,21
2,FALSE,"God if I don't know I've also been on the full-on-hater-side of a fence at times when it comes to certain films or series, but in the long run, it's just futile and only made me more frustrated.

2,FALSE,"I know this is immaterial to most people, but the elves hair... I hate it. I'm too used to Peter Jackson's elves having these long, gorgeous locks. And in tRoP the boy elves just have these short, terrible 80's haircuts. I was really distracted by it. Their hair belongs on boy band singers, not elves.",13,31
2,FALSE,"So, so happy the Dwarven royalty all look like Dwarves and not GAP models. Love the internal Elven political in-fighting stuff. Showcasing  this horribly tense truce between Elves and Men as it was on the ground way back then feels really well done and exciting. The visuals are stunning. Also, non-CGI orcs??

There were definitely a couple Galadriel bits I felt were cheeky and heavy handed, plus some pacing issues. But really, I’m surprised how much I liked about this. It’s leagues, LEAGUES better than “The Hobbit” already.",15,32
2,FALSE,For all the salt and shit dished out so far. I loved it! Perfect ? No was it great? Yes! Dwarves are awesome! Galadriel is an obsessed maniac so unlike her calm cool collected self in. Few thousand years. Really diggin the harfoots as well,12,33
2,FALSE,Really like the focus on the geography and maps.,12,34
2,FALSE,"The Khadaz-dûm music was *so* good, the male choir was incredibly badass. Best music so far in the show, what a way to introduce the dwarves",13,35
2,FALSE,"My thoughts on Ep 2…

Our first introduction to ‘comedy’ in RoP and I was really content with it - light, mild comic relief and great back-and-forth. Was really worried that they’d go down the ‘Marvel humour’ route with over the top comedic dialogue just for the sake of a laugh, but this was good and controlled - hopefully it stays that way!

Bear Mcreary’s score really thrived and came into its own in this episode - bolstering, improving and even carrying some scenes. Disappointingly slow advancement of the story in this episode, didn’t see the need/point for some parts of this episode and some scenes I felt were unnecessarily long and dragged out, but still some interesting and cool takeaways, nonetheless - some nice action sequences and the practical effects and CGI are still brilliant (although I wasn’t really sold on THAT orc - looked like a lost member of Slipknot 🤣!).

Highlight for me was Khazad Dûm - to see it in all its glory was so epic. It looked amazing and the Dwarves were the best thing about this episode - brilliant costumes/makeup and, again, some great acting and dialogue! 

My initial thoughts were a 6/10 for this one - but perhaps I’m being a bit harsh on this one due to my excitement following the first episode. Rewatching both episodes again tomorrow with Dash and am excited to do so which can only be a good thing! 

Weekly episodes from now on and I now can’t wait for Friday to come around so I think this means my cautious optimism has manifested into positivity following the first two episodes! A long way to go, plenty more could go wrong, a lot more could go right - but a great start to the series: long may it continue!",12,36
2,FALSE,"I wasn't one of the people pissing and crying about the show being ""woke,"" so I went in excited for it (I'm not a big fan of the trilogy and haven't read the books). I found it visually appealing but otherwise kind of slow. I am not gripped yet. Hopefully it will pick up.",12,37
2,FALSE,"I really like it a lot!

I had no idea what to expect, but I was hoping it wouldn’t be a letdown.

What I got was beautiful score and scenery that made me feel immersed, well written dialogue and good acting, and a couple wonky action scenes that looked dumb. I had a smile on my face most of the time.",11,38
2,FALSE,"I’m curious wether anyone felt that they had to suspend their disbelief at all at the presence of the non-white cast members? I certainly didn’t, and didn’t even realise that I didn’t (if that makes sense) until afterwards. I’m guessing it’s a minority that really care about this aspect of lore but so much promotion and criticism centred on it I wonder if anyone actually cared when it came to watching?",11,39
2,FALSE,"I've seen the Jackson movies and only read the Hobbit and parts of LotR (sorry couldn't get past Tom Bombadil) back in the day, so I'm not as clued up as some of you are.

* Absolutely cracking visuals in both eps, crazy how big they've gone for a TV show - they've even shot it in widescreen! (pretty unheard of for a TV show). Always enjoy a Bear McCready score.
* I'm glad they kept to a lot of the Jackson/Weta influenced designs - keeps the visual language consistent. Loved the art influences art Nouveau, deco, Pre-Raphaelite and Romanticism painters - very Raft of the Medusa in ep 2! (apologies for sounding like an art wanker).
* Great directing job by Bayona, he's rightfully kept it mainly to a conservative style of shot choices - letting the visuals do the work. That 'character walks to the hills edge to see the splendour' shot that he uses a couple of time works beautifully.
* I see Sauron's got his logo sorted already, must have good PR people :)
* As I mentioned, I've not read the books but these second age Elves seem much more human in their behaviours than the detached, somewhat ethereal ones from LotR (only Lee Pace in The Hobbit was the closest they had to a lemon-sucker). But that's fair enough, its growth as a species.
* The opening scene with the kids at the start was a bit of a cliche IMO. They give Galadriel a character journey from Year One (or Year 2000?) to what we know her as in the LotR era, which looks like it'll be interesting (as much as she's pissed off about Sauron here, she seemed a more laid back in LotR about it). Clark is great and I'm sold.
* I liked the Policeman Elf story, (it's parallels to US soldiers in a post-Nazi Berlin), that was an interest take. He's gone to the same Eastwood school of acting that Orlando Bloom did for LotR, but clearly knowingly asked to give much less in his role. Lovely costume design.
* Celebrimbor dude really really reminds me of the smarmy Warden from Hannibal Lecter's prison in Silence of the Lambs.
* At first I thought the Stranger was Sauron (eye imagery around him when he landed), but starting to think it's Gandalf, especially as his later attachment to hobbits may come from this bonding with these two diminutive helpers. Or it could be that Amazon paid 1 Billion for a Catweasel adaptation.
* Nori got that Frodo big blue eyes thing going on to draw that previous parallel and it'll be JarJar level tragic if he's the big Bad and she inadvertently helps him along.
* Enjoyed this Boy Band version of Elrond meeting the Dwarves. The dwarf couple were great fun, probably my fave characters so far - I am disappointed that she doesn't have a beard (you cowards!).
* These must be the Durins that emo, jewel junkie Thorin Oakenshield keeps mentioning in the Hobbit. Did not recognise Peter Mullins as King Durin!
* I was thinking that may be the Arkenstone they'd found, but that's in the other mountain, so it must be the material they made Frodo's chainmail out of (really helped that I rewatched all the movies last couple of weeks!)
* Great to see the Dwarves underground city from LotR in its full glory -  like Detroit Motor City in its heyday.
* Also - where the horses at?",11,40
2,FALSE,"Is it worth a watch? Yes, I believe so.

Overall, I am pleasantly surprised with the series so far. It was an enjoyable watch and will likely be a gateway into the LOTR universe for people that the movies and books couldn't capture.

I thought the first episode was possibly stronger than the second; I really enjoyed being introduced to the different characters and much prefer this “version” of Galadriel to Jackson’s. I also enjoyed the prologue-summary which felt like a good way to bring the audience up to speed with the broad strokes of the first age. 

Obviously the Gil-Galad “allowing them” to go back to the undying lands was a bit contrived, but overall I thought it was very positive. 8 or 9 out of 10 so far.

The only thing which really got to me was the heavy footsteps of the elves, which just seemed out of place.",9,45

What exactly was Galadriel's plan in front of the Queen Regent of Numenor and being hyper aggressive and insulting everyone? At this point she already is aware that the city looks down on Elves. Was she going to fight her way through that entire crowd? How was she going to sail a small boat by herself across the Sundering Seas?

3,FALSE,"Good god Numenor looked absolutely *gorgeous*. Definitely one of the most beautiful fictional environments I've seen in a while. That one panoramic night view of the city was a magnificent achievement in digital artistry. Very well done. 

I did kinda let out a sad laugh when Halbrand nicked Elendil's dagger and then proceeded to """"""discreetly"""""" hand it to Galadriel in the middle of a big ol' crowded chamber where people are supposed to be very much aware of their existence. That could have been scripted better. 

Halbrand doesn't look like an idiot, so I don't know why or how he'd think simply stealing another smith's pin thing would have been enough to let him work as one himself. Pretty sure simply possessing one of those, which is most likely like a badge than a permit or license anyway, is not enough. Numenor Blacksmiths Union wouldn't let non-union workers do the job because that opens the whole business up to exploitation from the upper class. Can't have it.

3,FALSE,"I continue to enjoy this show.

* Main takeaway for me is Numenor, lovely bit of world building. For all the crap that the Queen got beforehand, she did a decent job here in her first appearance.
* The Numenorian architecture in RoP is incredible. That post-Roman Constantinople look with smatterings of decadent eleven architecture really visually tells the story about the island.  I caught bits of Gondor in  there from the LotR movies in there which was a nice touch.
* The look of the citizens and lighting was very painterly - maann, a drawback of streaming is I don't know if we'd ever get an extended edition boxed set like the LotR sets that were absolute full of making of videos - would love that!
* Isildur's dad was well cast - he had echos of his ancestor Aragon and grave a great performance.
* I do like a 'Giles in the library investigating The Big Bad' scene - had two just recently, in this show and in &gt;!Sandman!&lt;.
* Some of the Harfoot stuff felt a bit extraneous this week, but really enjoyed the heartfelt roll call of those they couldn't take because they dies or were lost). Man, Poppy's whole family - can understand her cautiousness now. Enjoyed them all hiding under their cloaks when The Stranger scares them, very Hobbit-like.
* I'd place a Vegas bet on The Stranger being Gandalf (do they even have the rights to any of the Blue wizard guys?)
* Enjoyed the Elf prisoner stuff - really like the Orc designs, they really do come across as like a deviant versions of elves. RIP that tree.
* To minorly nitpick - the pacing in this one wasn't as great as the Bayona directed eps - not a fan of the slo-mo horse riding scene, that came across as a parody perfume ad. But y'know - we saw some horses!  :)
* If the pacing continues like this, I may start getting a little bored down the road (especially with too few eps to go and ages until new ones)
* Now we see Galadriel properly amongst humans she does look tiny (but that's not really a big issue for me - Legolas in the movies was average sized too)
* As a related aside, I'm not a fan the trend of analysing this show by freeze-framing (I suspect many have their own agenda in looking for reasons to trash it) it's not how any show or movie is supposed to be consumed. Especially when dissing the composition of still frames snatched from moving shot - thats almost comedic in its ignorance.
* On that note - the Warg. Seen a lot of disingenuous and constant RoP headlining with ""A billion spent and we get this!"". Not quite. A massive chunk was buying the rights and money was spread across on a ton of things - some of the CGI is going to be TV standard, costs won't cover all to feature level perfection. the hardest is creature design and animation - I'll give them a break for the odd imperfection (and frankly that Warg did the job it was supposed to while simply watching the show).

3,FALSE,"I forget his name but the elf who escaped the pit and was shot by arrows. Does anyone know if those were orcs who shot him or humans?

I felt this episode was the one where I'm finally starting to feel invested in the show. 

Also I really like the orcs being allergic to the sunlight dynamic and how they adjust to it via the canopies and using slave labor for doing work in the sun. I hope later they explain why the sun affects them and why orcs in the later ages don't seem to have that problem.",13,33
3,FALSE,"I'm still liking this a lot, but I really hope things start to kick off soon. There's been enough setup, I want to see where things are actually going.

To compare it with Fellowship (just in terms of pacing), it feels like the first two episodes were basically the equivalent of the prologue up through Bilbo's party, if Bilbo disappearing was used as a cliffhanger. This episode feels kind of like Frodo learning about the ring, travelling to Bree, and meeting Aragorn.

Hopefully that means we'll reach the equivalent of the Council of Elrond by episode 5, then the second half of the season is the real meat of the story. With a week between each episode, it'll be hard to wait any longer than that.",11,34

Actor is also kind of stiff.",13,35

4,FALSE,"For me, best episode so far. The introduction of Adar and his conversation with Arondir was fascinating. Am really curious where they are going with Adar. It would almost be more interesting if he was a mere servant of Sauron instead of the Dark Lord himself.

Likewise Theo's storyline is going somewhere. The trailer for EP5 showed Brownyn holding the sword hilt, but I almost want Theo to keep it just to see what it does to him.

The twilight, almost ghastly forest chase scene ending with the escape into the sunlight, just avoiding the Orcs' arrows, was very well done.

Intrigued by Celembrimbor's conversation with Elrond. Celembrimbor seems to be holding something back, and am not trusting that all is well with him.

The Mithril reveal with Durin and Elrond was well done; love seeing the kingdom of Moria in its glory. When the Balrog finally makes its appearance it should be fantastic (and tragic).

Pharazôn stepped it up in this episode and showed a higher level of leadership.

Still truly dislike how the show has nerfed Galadriel's character from the ageless wise enchantress down into an angry teen warrior, (never going to get over this one) but her conversation with Miriel during the Palantir scene was her most mature yet.

This is a 5 season show and a lot of this is just set dressing / world building. Many of the journalists who reviewed the show had access to the first 6 episodes and many said it doesn't pick up and really get going until episode 5. 

Give it until the end of the season guys. It's not like you have anything better to watch on a Friday.",48,8
4,FALSE,"I loved the interactions between Elrond and Durin, especially the comedic retelling of how they met. Serious Legolas and Gimli vibes. There’s just something about the intersection of graceful elegance and brash pridefulness that works so damn well.

I also appreciate that the orcs in the show present a genuine threat. Arondir is fearful of them and chooses to run and use the sun as refuge. In the movies the protagonists just plow through hordes of orcs like it’s nothing. Just gives the scenes with orcs real stakes, like I legitimately thought “oh shit this dude might actually die saving this mom and her son”.

Glad there were no Harfoots, and hopefully that doesn’t mean future episodes will be Harfoot heavy. It’s just filler until they show us who comet man is (Gandalf).

It’s weird because I am really intrigued with the Galadriel plot line, but just can’t stand Galadriel. I don’t care that she’s not lore accurate cuz imo a lore accurate show would be boring as shit. It’s that she’s portrayed like the protagonist of a young adult novel. Like this is not how powerful graceful immortal beings would act. She’s thousands of years old yet if she doesn’t get everything she wants immediately she throws a fit. It’s dumb. Like bitch you asked a nation to commit to war maybe give Miriel a night to sleep on it.

Halbrand is Sauron. Convenient that the city is sending its warriors off yet he’s sticking around and so is that Pharazon dude.

I didn't mind it though, Galadriel needed to have some flaws. Only thing is maybe she should have used some magic to escape prison (like she did magic on the paper boat). That being said, there was great humor this episode, even though the tone is serious it made me laugh out loud several times. Like ""you couldn't remember your face if you had a mirror in front of you"". Also I just love the orc designs. Oh my god they are so cute. That look of pure joy on the injured orc meeting Adar.

4,FALSE,"Everything with Elrond and the dwarves is pretty great imo, I love the acting and relationships. Disa singing to the mountain was awesome. So many good moments here.

For the southlands plot I like Arondir mostly, his focused bow scene was cool, but Bronywn and Theo are not very compelling to me. Was interesting to see the old guy who owned the broken sword and is still a Morgoth loyalist. Clearly building up to a conflict soon here. I want to see more of the sword's effects come into play with Theo.

The Numenor plot is ok. The city itself and scenery is beautiful. The Palantir vision stuff is intriguing. The citizens getting riled up over elves and the Queen, then Pharazon calming them while still kinda agreeing with them makes me think he'll seize power while the Queen is away. The ending was amazing I thought, the petals falling from the tree, Miriel immediately knowing she fucked up, and then staring straight past Elendil back at Galadriel on the boat. Also Isildur finally doing anything. Galadriel has good moments but is just too wooden imo she is portrayed as a robot.",21,25

A little thrown that Arondir happened to be able to sit just outside the forest and have a cheesy stare-down like not a single other bow was available until conveniently fired as they decide to leave. 

I can mental gymnastics why newly born ground dwelling creatures like orcs would be sensitive to sunlight, but it seems like it only truly hurts them at convenient times. They couldn’t all rush 30 yards for a matter of second to swarm him? 

Also why do orcs have funerals now when in the trilogy they have a brutal society and absolute willingness to murder and/or eat each other? Seemed like it wasn’t intended to be a societal thing that developed, but rather just because they’re inherently dirty evil little creatures.

Man has to be either Sauron or tied to him in some way I just know it. The foreshadowing that Galadriel staying in Middlearth would bring about the thing she is trying to prevent - can't shake that.

That aside, hope you don't mind me saying (not sure what the consensus around here is) but I love this show and really enjoyed this last episode. It was slow but I liked it like that. It showcased a lot. The passion and tranquility of being a smith, the greed and also despair of humans, at least a bit about the hilt, the significance of friendship but also the boldness to make a great joke in serious moments with a straight face... Durin and Elrond are such marvelous characters. Galadriel I am still on the fence, she's just too set in her way to narrow focused - but I guess this story is how she grows. And I think the king of the elves is very well played. Numenorians are a bit too inconsistent for me, but I think that's more to do with pacing and trying to fit a lot of things in a short series.

And I think the stranger is discovering his role in the world and the importance of hobbits to Gandalf may come from this if he turns out to be Gandalf - since he was ""raised"" or taught values by them - and in turn he's seen the potential that many would not. I think it's very nice how they present magic - as this thing that is powerful but a double edged sword - something that can bring about a lot of good but also bad, and something that shouldn't be used lightly for the toll it might take intentionally or not.

I think that would be a great lesson for the magician, and if it turns out to be Gandalf it would (for me) explain why he's not often so flashy about using magic to solve everything - or should I say it would make sense in the world that you can't just use magic for everything due to the toll it might take on you. As such it would give more balance to the potential of other fractions/races.

5,FALSE,"The Stranger asking ""I'm peril"" feels like some serious foreshadowing, not going to lie. That aside, I very much still like the harfoots far more than I expected.

For people complaining how Bronwyn apparently ""spontaneously"" became the leader of her village, keep in mind she was the first one to sound the alarm on the orcs and then brought back *physical* evidence of the danger they were in. She was also the village healer beforehand (which an incredibly important role in the village, especially since they bring even their sickly cattle to her). So it makes sense they'd mostly follow her lead, I don't understand how can someone miss this. In a similar regard, some of the village people started following the old man by the virtue of him being old and reinforcing the fears of some of them.

Sadoc being shocked at the old lady's suggestion of ""taking their wheels"" shows that the harfoots probably avoid leaving their companions unless they deem it absolutely necessary (the deaths named in the previous episodes are completely non-preventable). Being placed at the back is obviously not a full death-sentence, but merely some form of punishment.

Elrond spoke to Gil-Galad with some incredible audacity there, but yknow, major props to Elrond for not cracking and breaking his oath immediately on the spot.

Isildur not just leaving when Kemen told him to probably worked out in his favor, knowing the kind of man Pharazon is and the fact Kemen seems to be his lackey  (well, his son, but that's the vibe I got.) 

I really do not understand how anyone can continue to think Halbrand is Sauron after this. It's pretty clear he isn't and likely a red herring, I doubt't they'd set up his whole backstory otherwise.

The way Waldreg just says ""You're Sauron, yknow."" gets me, like the dude was so casual about it. Props to the show for not having a character pussy out of a classic ""Kill X person to prove yourself worthy"" type decision, Waldreg really went for it.

Another props for the fact that they had Elrond explain the situation clearly to Durin. No stumbling about it, no lies, deflecting (I.E blaming Gil-Galad for tricking him to find out about mithril), or fighting over a clear a forced misunderstanding, and taking like the next 2 episodes to explain. The meat was given, and it was given raw as Durin would sey. Oh, and the fact Durin listened whilst *not* throw the ""how dare you!"" tantrum, he actually took the time to listen and understood what Elrond was talking about. With little hesitation, Durin was willing to help his close friend and by extension, the elven race as a whole ~~as they think so anyway~~.

Halbrand looks even more like Aragorn after his glow-up, another reason why I can't understand why people think he's Sauron besides the fact he knows how to smith and is charismatic. I also don't see any ""romantic"" tension between him and Galadriel, it's pretty clear they're simply on friendly terms. 

Overall, a pretty nice episode and feels better paced than the previous ones. Only exception I can think of being the boats in Numenor being set on fire, then seemingly being brushed aside relatively quickly, like quicker than they should have. I'd have thought it could have been argued as some sort of omen to stop them from leaving for Middle Earth.",43,10

Then go and talk about it with Durin",30,15
5,FALSE,"(EDIT) I wrote the original comment while a lil' drunk and it came out a bit more sour than I care for. I think I'd like to clarify what things I do like about the show:

* Durin and Disa are great characters with great lines and genuine warmth
* The hypocrisy of Harfoot society sets up great tension in character interactions - Sadoc feels like he's genuinely torn between caring about his people and acting on the (apparently) standard Harfoot cowardice that compels them to run away from anything that could cause problems
* Adar being an orc-sympathetic character is interesting and something that a more modern take on LotR is really equipped to interrogate

To try to summarize more lucidly my issue with the show: it feels like way too many cooks in the kitchen have made for some bland and disjointed courses. Clearly I'm stretching here, but when I see some scenes I'm forced to imagine a writers' room in which there are too many people with too many ideas and nobody is brave enough to seriously challenge another writer (which is how you end up with so many pieces of bad dialog and inconsistent or out-of-the-blue character behavior). I also think a lack of singular vision for the plot is why there's no clear \*believable\* conflict yet and sometimes the show seems like just a sequence of scenes happening back to back (numenor's queen going to the southlands because of Halbrand's hearsay is not believable, the southland villagers not ALL either submitting to Adar or just running away scared is not believable, the elves needing to vampirize mithril to survive is painfully deus ex machina and weird and not believable, the harfoots don't even have a plot purpose yet).

I think the biggest consequence of this disjointedness is most of the characters are worse than 1 dimensional, they are completely unpredictable or beholden to the lurching plot points of the show.

* Miriel feels like she has 0 agency. She will just very reluctantly do whatever the plot asks of her, and look unhappy doing it.
* Isildur??? you want to go west? now you want to go east? why? to do what? for whom? to do something great? I really dislike sitting through Isildur's scenes with his cliche fantasy friends - one strong-willed friend who's a little brooding or conflict prone, one comic relief friend who's dumb but lovable.
* Isildur's sister and pharazon's son's romance seems really shoe-horned to create the conditions for conflict that could have been more interesting if it had been made more direct. Imagine if Pharazon had no son, and Eärien was trying to sabotage the mission to middle earth herself. Numenor clearly has a society of open discourse, what if she had spoken with Pharazon herself. What if she actually challenged Elendil and Isildur directly herself. This romance dilutes things by adding an unnecessary character to make plotting easier for the writers, or worse, to avoid making Eärien too unlikable to the audience.
* On the note of perhaps not wanting main characters to be too unlikable - Theo obviously should have gone with the villagers to Adar. That was how his character was being set up. Why the sudden change? Wouldn't it be far more interesting to have made Theo actually hate elves? Actually hate Arondir? Actually generate real conflict between Arondir and Bronwyn?
* Arondir and Bronwyn have no agency either, they just do what the plot needs them to. Why is Bronwyn pseudo-in-charge of the village? Because she's the only one whose clothes have color? What if they made it explicit that she was the wife of the village's dead or missing leader (ie: perhaps Halbrand)? That would make her speech at the beginning of the episode feel at least a little more natural.
   * On this note, I think there was almost a good idea in this episode re: the willingness of the villagers to submit themselves to Adar. The situation should have just felt more hopeless to begin with. These villagers seem destitute, and they've basically been oppressed by an elvish police state for centuries (millennia?). Why wouldn't they be willing to run to the enemy of the elves? Make the willingness of the villagers to turn to Adar not an indictment of them, but of the elves. To do this, you have to make  Waldred less cartoonishly evil. Make him aware that going to Adar might be bad, but really stress that he doesn't feel they have another choice. Make him somewhat sympathetic (like a Denethor maybe).
* Did anyone at any moment believe Halbrand wasn't going to go to middle earth? No, because they didn't actually make it feel like he wanted to stay in numenor (they didn't make it feel like he wanted to do anything really - he just goes where Galadriel goes). He \*said\* he wanted to stay in numenor a few times, but despite preaching moderation to Galadriel to get what she wants, he tries to steal his way into a smithing job and beats up a bunch of numenorians. Someone who really wanted to stay, who counseled Galadriel the way he did, would have known to behave better, more consistently, more deferentially. His whole smithing side quest felt fake. (Maybe this is a Sauron gotcha fake-out. He wants Galadriel to believe he doesn't want to return to the Southlands to make it easier to eventually be credulously instated as king there. But if it is a fake out, doing things like making Halbrand hesitate to grab the sigil at the end of the episode are actually then out-of-character actions intended solely to trick the viewer, and not to trick anyone in universe, which is very bad writing. If he's both Sauron AND conflicted it's even weirder - he's conflicted about choosing one of two paths: hm, should I 1) go back to middle earth and dominate all life there, or should I 2) just stay and smith away my days peacefully in numenor...).
* Galadriel is the biggest victim. Just behaving erratically to get from point a to point b. I'm hoping that as we see her character develop, we see more and more self-doubt, because that's really what this character needs to become interesting.

It is so clear the throwing money and production at something doesn't make it good. This is the Avatar of television shows. Hype but somewhat hollow. Somehow adding more people to the production has perhaps weakened the filter on quality. Things look and sound bad. Numenor looks like rendered backgrounds for Magic the Gathering cards. Dialog (which can be good at points - Miriel's 'faith is too fine a thread on which to hang a kingdom') at other times feels like it was generated by a deep quotes AI (you know the episode 1 quote I'm referring to here...). I hope it gets better, which I think means I hope the writing and directing room gets more authoritarian tbh. We need one person's internally consistent and interesting story, not a fanfic grab bag.

\--- vvv --- original comment below --- vvv ----

It's difficult for me to imagine specifically getting into everything that's wrong with this show, so I think I'll just say this - It really, really feels like 10000 writers got together and storyboarded this whole season, and then were sent off into completely separate groups of 100 writers to write one 10 minute scene each or something like that. There's just no feeling of real substantive character or plot development or continuity even, except with Elrond and the dwarves (and honestly I don't like Elrond that much, mostly just the dwarves) and the Harfoots to some extent (I actually think they have the most interesting character interactions). There's no feeling of organic connective tissue to the events of the show.

So many scenes feel like they all began with a very abstract and plot-agnostic premise that's meant to carbon copy some aspect of the original Peter Jackson films:- now we need a slow mo scene with sad music (a la Boromir's death scene)- now we need an elf ninja fight scene (a la Legolas nonsense)- now we need an inspiring speech to a crowd of people getting ready to fight a hopeless battle (a la Theodin or Aragorn)- now we need a hobbit song (a la Bilbo)

The problem is none of these scenes are earned, and they're hardly even built up to - they're just fucking plopped into the middle of the narrative and characters are forced to act as though what's happening is entirely natural. Like, wtf was that Bronwyn speech at the beginning of this episode. Did the moment really feel like it called for an inspirational speech like that? Why would the villagers at all be emotionally ready to swear themselves into a fight against this unknown enemy that they literally haven't even seen. They have NOT SEEN the orcs. They've seen one orc head, and that's it. And suddenly the moment calls for an inspirational 'let's stand our ground and fight in this tower' scene? It felt like the moment should have called for something much more measured.

And Poppy's song!? This could have been done well. This could have been done tastefully. How did it end up so grossly overbaked? So clearly studio produced, too long, and with a weird semi-animated Indiana Jones map crawl sequence?

And what was Galadriel's advice for killing orcs? Kill them the way you'd kill anything? By stabbing and gutting them? That whole scene was pretense to show Galadriel being an elf ninja, which like, can't you just do that in a regular fight scene? Nobody genuinely thinks that that 5 minute lesson taught anyone anything about how to fight orcs right? It makes Galadriel and Elendil actually look like idiots.

gosh gosh gosh I just don't know. I just want clean no nonsense story telling over whatever this is at this point. The screenwriters seem to think that every scene needs to have an exclamation point or something, but it makes everything in this universe feel so artificial and manufactured. I just want characters that behave normally and sensibly.

Also obviously the dialogue leaves so so much to be desired. 'Why don't you stop fighting?' 'Oof jeez Lord Halbrand, guess I just can't'

\- Elrond losing that ""duel"" with Durin and being banned, but then he can stay because he is friends with Durin?

\- Elrond breaking his oath with Durin and him not minding at all.

\- This guy in Numenor sabotaging a fleet, multiple explosions, multiple damaged ships but nobody cares. No investigation or panic. All it needs is Isildur making up one sentence. Also no questioning what he made on the ship.

\- Numenor in general with a lot of supposed tension and suspension, but nothing really lasts.

Let's see how this thing continues, but I'd like to have less switching sides and obvious characters ""he is bad"" -""no she is good"",... why not people with consistent and understandable motivations?",19,36
5,FALSE,Oh my god I love the hobbits so much. I could watch them for hours. And that song.... wow.,17,37

Pharazôn in Numenor doing his best politicking and maneuvering, the kid who tried to burn the ship is an idiot, why didn't the son report him? Because he would also be potentially implicated in the burning? Stowing away didn't seem like a huge crime as got on the ship later anyway.",17,42
5,FALSE,"It's bothering me that everybody is so set on putting Halbrand on a throne when there has been no evidence given that he's the heir. Galadriel sees the mark on his necklace(?) and immediately jumps to that conclusion which he always avoids confirming.

5,FALSE,"Thought this episode was quite good.

Gil-Galad is shady af.  Despite all the exposition I kinda didn't quite get why he thinks mythril is going to save the elves.  At first I thought he just wanted a bunch of mythril armor but now it kinda seems like it's literally going to save their rotting tree and/or keep the elves from becoming mortal?  Except he also thought exiling Galadriel would save the tree and it totally didn't work, so he's obviously just trying random shit.  I haven't read the books in a jillion years ... are the Rings made of mythril?  Do the elven rings help keep them from ""diminishing""?  I guess I'll have to wait and see ...

Still don't understand why Numenorians hate elves or why some of them (especially the daughter) think Galadriel is ""warmongering"".  She's not taking them on an expedition to steal land from another country, they're literally going to go try to stop orcs from destroying Middle-Earth.  Obviously in real life this is the kind of nonsense we use to justify invading Iraq or whatever, but in the Tolkienverse orcs seem to be 100% objectively evil.

6,FALSE,The music during the chase scene after Adar in the forest was BUMPIN.,69,12
6,FALSE,I enjoyed Galadriel's confrontation/conversation with Adar. It added some moral complexity &amp; ambiguity to the show. I have a problem with the idea that one race is utterly good and one race is utterly evil. Galadriel comes off as both a racist and a religious fanatic in this scene. Don't get me wrong. This doesn't make Adar or Uruk any less evil but it does suggest that they have more complex motivations than we have seen thus far.,69,13

6,FALSE,"Youk now, I have to hand it to Arondir, the tower plan was a pretty clever way to distract his enemies. Since that's a large amount of them being killed or injured, giving them time to move out and prepare whilst the enemy tries to recuperate.

Isildur sharing his apple with the horse is just nasty, that's all.

Arondir's persistance in trying to smash the hilt is admirable but like, one or two tries should be enough to know it wont work my man. Props to Bronwyn for not forcing Theo in with those in the established fallback point to ""protect"" him. He might not be in the front lines, but he's still being given a chance to fight and protect others.

The moment Arondir said ""and Theo"" in his talk with Bronwyn, he just became 100% hotter, the dude is fully willing to be a father to a kid that ain't his. At the same time, I hate these kind of moments before battles, they definitely hint to something bad happening to either party involved (Bronwyn in this case). Speaking of battles, *why didn't they just continue moving instead of trying to battle an army that grossly outnumbers and outgears them.*It's an admirable effort, but it just doesn't feel like the most tactically sound one.*

Why they gotta immediately assume Bronwyn died when it could have easily been her passing out from bloodloss smh. On the otherhand, that was a lot more gore than I expected, like wow.

Those orcs really took their time breaking in as well. I know Theo is a kid, but like, it should have taken like much foresight to know that Adar and the orcs wont spare them even after giving the hilt.

I really love how they showed how a calvalry charge would trample any enemy footmen and not magically stop their horses (unless they had a shield wall like the Lannister army in GoT). Though, why the hell would you ever willingly dismount your horse in the middle of an open field battle. I like how the tails of the horses were tied up as well, it makes completely sense in terms of practicality. 

The sight of Adar just, taking one of the horses in a panic is kinda funny not gonna lie. Very cowardly, but what can you do at that point when your entire army is swamped and soon going to be burning in direct sunlight? Poor horse though getting tripped, at least it didn't get speared like I expected it to.

Adar did *what*. My eyebrows went through the roof into space when he said what he did to Sauron. At least, he's definitely a very unreliable narrator and probably trying to bullshit himself out of his situation and piss off Galadriel.

Something clicked in my head between Halbrand and Adar's interaction, Adar's talk with Galadriel, and a thought I had after episode 5. Let's say &gt;!*if* the Halbrand is Sauron theory is true (a big *IF*), the direction I see Halbrand coming with Galadriel and meeting Gil-Galad and Celebrimbor, then he ends up working with Celebrimbor at his forge. IF this happens, consider me sold on this theory even though I had vehemently denied it for a while. If it doesn't, then he's very much a red herring.!&lt;

Another eyebrow raise, I'm not sure if Halbrand is lying about taking his little pouch being from a dead man or not now. If he did, that's one hell of a way to going from no name dude to king.

Ah.... so that was the task Adar gave to Waldreg. That was actually pretty damn clever and actually shows how dedicated Adar is to his task. Dude was willing to use himself as a scapegoat just to achieve it, even if it meant putting trust in some slimy old dude for it. Which just kinda confirms my feeling that Adar was bullshitting to Galadriel.

I love they showed the shockwave from the eruption, such a neat little detail I don't see very often. Overall, a great episode in my opinion, not perfect nor the best and definitely very questionable for book readers, but Im too tired to get into all the flaws here.",64,15

His background was established. His motivation and intent is clear. The actor is phenomenal. I saw myself empathizing with him more than with Galadriel. 

After today’s episode it’s pretty clear that Halbrand and Galadriel will end up fighting for the opposite sides. The insinuation of it was pretty strong.

6,FALSE,KABOOM,27,33
6,FALSE,"That episode was dope. I loved watching Galadriel ride in and immediately be several tiers above the field as a fighter. We already know she survives the entire series so might as well give her a bunch of crazy feats.

It puts into perspective just how powerful her “company” of like 10 elves from episode 1 was. We’ve already seen how Arondir is a clear heads and shoulders above the regular orcs, and then he sees Galadriel and is like “holy shit that’s Commander Galadriel”.

Gives me little doubt that if Numinor had just given Galadriel a ship when she first asked for one, she could have sailed back earlier and just handled the whole situation with Adar on her own.",25,34

Why didn't the villagers just run away during the day time rather then hole up in a shitty village?

6,FALSE,"Hot damn, now *that* was a good episode. Episode 3 was my favorite before this, but this definitely takes the cake. Pretty sweet action sequence. The chase on the horses was beautiful to watch. Tons of plot movement. Great character development. Awesome.

Few nidpicks, thought it was strange of them to cut to the Numenoreans charging to the Southlands mid fight, it made the timeline of events feel awkward.

Still sick, excited to see what's next.",20,47

A few of my thoughts:

1. How did Numenoreans know the exact village they have to go to to fight with orcs?

2.  A sudden burst of wisdom from Galadriel about how revenge won't ease Halbrand's feelings and she's been seeking revenge since the beginning of the show. And then she wants to kill him while he is held hostage.

3. Halbrand could really be Sauron if killing him is what makes him hate Adar

4. The sword being the key for opening Mount Doom was not as bad as I thought it will be",19,48

7,FALSE,Yo Balrogs really don't like leaves.,67,8
7,FALSE,"Holy shit the scene between Durin Jr and Durin Sr was so good it alone puts the rest of the show to shame for paling so much in comparison. I don't understand how the same producers could green light that scene and the uncomfy Arondir x Bronwyn seed planting sesh from last episode (or any of the many other uncomfy, weird, or pointless character interactions we've seen up until now).

I also liked the almost sinister Disa at the end of the episode. It was an interesting move from a character that I felt was being framed as much more wholesome.

That said, I'm a little confused about the conflict there - in what way is Durin Sr clinging to the past? It seemed more like he was just worried about a mining disaster? Was it established that there was some accident that occurred in the past that explains his general trepidation?

Also, why was the corrupted leaf on Durin Jr's table? Was that established before and I missed it as well? And I feel it wasn't emphasized enough that the dwarves were at least somewhat skeptical the mithril would help the elves to begin with, because otherwise I don't see why seeing the mithril cure the leaf would have been framed as such a revelatory moment. It seemed like Durin mostly believed Elrond to begin with, the curing leaf added no new information - I concede that perhaps it added urgency though? Seeing the 'cure' in action?

I sort of liked the Galadriel and Theo conversation. I feel like the writers were trying to show Galadriel feeling like the ruin of the Southlands was a reflection of her poisoned spirit and thus her fault (ie: a direct 'moral' consequence of her threatening Adar with orc genocide in the previous episode). We're getting the character arc we thought we were promised, I just think it's a little hurky-jerky (here's a genocidal Galadriel, five minutes of Galadriel screen time later - here's a repentant Galadriel telling Theo not to feel good about killing orcs).

A meta comment I have is that I think I'm generally growing more and more tired of media feeling like it needs to do bait and switch sleight of hand with emotions or information. I don't need to be made to wonder whether or not the hair of this dead person I'm seeing belongs to Bronwyn. I don't need to wonder if Bronwyn is dead at all. Either give me a genuine emotional performance from Theo discovering his actually dead mother, or show me she's alive from the get go. Another example: if Halbrand == Sauron is True, I personally think that the whole show would be better if we knew this from the beginning. If we could see how his actions were either scheming, or the actions of a Sauron repentant in real time it would be much more interesting. If we could see explicitly that Galadriel's hubris and single-minded pursuit of vengeance is actively bringing Sauron back into play in middle earth, that's more compelling and makes for a better tragic story. I guess I'm just tired of twists and unnecessary questions. Stories can be good even when we the audience have all or most of the information (and this is how good stories have been written since the dawn of storytelling in fact).

Galadriel: went from “Orc genocide” to “war is hell” in two mins of on screen time. The pacing of this show is all over the place. Shows zero interest in the fate of Halbrand, the man at the centre of her personal plot, the man she pushed and guilted into returning to the Southlands, following the eruption. His current condition is treated as an afterthought until it conveniently becomes a reason to get them both out of the mountains. Speaking of afterthought, her brother didn’t return from war, and oh yes neither did my husband but oh well. This little fact was of zero consequence up until now and just creates potential for some more plot convolutions later.

Halbrand: somehow grievously wounded, giving a death bed performance rivalled only by Theoden in LOTR cinematic history, and then thirty seconds later taking a leisurely stroll through his people, the same people he only became king of yesterday, to again ride off half way across the world for some vital life saving elvish treatment, elvish treatment that Arondir says is really of the soul. I could think of a million ways to get Halbrand to Eregion that are better than this, but really what would be better is not to pursue this path I fear they are on with him. 

Isildur: pretending he is dead, even for casuals, is dumb. The name is synonymous with possession of the ring at some stage so if anyone has seen the films there is no tension whatsoever in this plot point. His father wants to leave these lands forever but will not stick to it and so once again the decisions made by the writers on this show are of zero consequence. Nothing matters. Everything is momentary in this world they’ve created.

Adar: the single most interesting thing they’ve done in this show, a sympathetic evil character. They’ve given him this orc liberation arc and I’m curious where it goes, but the Mordor name reveal was amateurish. 

Durin and Elrond: I love both of these, and Durin’s wife. I just don’t love the Mithril plot. I was hoping it was a myth Sauron sowed to sow discord between the races, create a sense of haste and hasten the release of Durin’s Bane, the classic “our survival relies on something you won’t relinquish willingly”, but instead they are persisting with the “Mithril as race saver” plot and confirmed it with the leaf gimmick. 

So many questions and so few answers: any forge update lads? Presumably the dwarves stopped construction once Elrond was found down in the Mithril mine? Why does it feel like there are 100 people in middle earth? Why exaggerate Elrond’s height relative to dwarves but then shoot shots showing Galadriel shorter than a human child?

I wish the writers would come up with more original scenes and dialogue than what’s so obviously taken or inspired from the films. I was reciting Arwen’s “why do you fear the past” dialogue for Aragorn alongside Galadriel responding to Halbrand, it was just too similar. I mean, do they think it’s not obvious?

This should have been developped over 6 episodes and not as a conclusion to a very uneven and flat season. And it would have allowed them to have Sauron/Halbrand's manipulation of Celebrimbor be much more subtle and insidious, spanning over longer periods of time.

But either way, Galadriel’s decision to save her people, despite knowing it was Sauron who encouraged/provided the salvation, was an interesting choice.

I forgive the messiness of season one, trying to force a millennia of history into one season. Whether or not they put together a successful narrative will be a lot clearer now that the story appears to be in motion.",25,33

8,FALSE,"My impressions of the last episode:

Gandalf has been killing it on duolingo lately.

Visually it was really a perfect episode, except maybe the last scene where we see Sauron up close in Mordor.

Why, why on earth did Galadriel continue to produce the rings of power when she is 100% sure they were tricked by Sauron.

The rings of power as the main theme of the tv series had to be more represented in the sense that the main plot with Sauron in Eregion should have been covered in several episodes, and not in 15 minutes of the last episode.

My impressions of the first season:

I waited a long time for this series to come out and I must admit that it did not impress me. The dialogue between the characters is not stimulating in the least, to the point where it is almost impossible to develop any feelings for the main characters. The story has so many holes that every 5 minutes you wonder why or how it is even possible that something happened the way it did. A lot of time is wasted on repeating scenes and actions that we have already seen instead of the story progressing and gaining depth.

As for Numenor, I'm sorry they aren't shown as a greater power, but an island that loves the sea and sends volunteers to the war their queen goes to! On the other hand, I liked Adar as a character. Mysterious and in my opinion the best written of all the characters in the series. Also, the way the orcs were portrayed was fantastic in my opinion and I have nothing but praise for that part.  


Also: when you have billion dollars to spend, why not take the best showrunners possible and class A actors? Why??",28,35

Ah well, it was going to have a very hard time meeting expectations. Still have the hope that future seasons will improve.",21,42
8,FALSE,"Unpopular opinion: I really liked the ""I am GOOD"" line that Gandalf shouted when he wielded the staff. It was a nice callback to when Nori had told him he was good earlier in the season. Actually gave me shivers when I watched it.

Old king dying, Isildur fake dead, Elendil blaming Galadriel for a goddamn magical volcano that nobody could have suspected in their wildest dreams, Nori getting away from the blasted Harfoots, and all this business with Galadriel and the other Elves and Halbrand... none of it resonates because in some cases the conflict is contrived and in general the buildups have been poor. The action with the warlocks wasn't exciting. And the climatic drama of Sauron's reveal didn't land for obvious reasons - honestly, if I hadn't seen any online chatter and only watched the show in a room by myself then I probably would have been surprised, but oh well. 

The one thing where I felt smidgen of emotion was when Sadoc died. It was a sad and poetic moment. For all the problems that the Harfoots have, Sadoc did have good scenes with Nori and he was a reasonably likable and well-developed character. Unfortunately even the potential of his death scene was squandered for a bunch of reasons - Gandalf doesn't even try to heal him, the sun comes up with bizarre suddenness, and the actor makes a somewhat odd face and just dies in a few seconds on screen.",17,45

It doesn’t feel like anyone had a vision for this show or is leading it, instead it feels like it comes from consensus by committee.  

It’s entertaining enough, but when this amount of money and energy gets invested into something so middling it just makes me frustrated. Just feels like a thing that exists because of some billionaire’s ego and because a lot of senior executives and brand holders want to find a way to make money by painting by numbers.
