I am a principal statistician at Alcon and hold a Ph.D. in Statistics from Baylor University. I also have an MS in Statistics as well as undergraduate degrees in Statistics, Mathematics, Economics, and Management of Information Systems.

I am very interested in computational statistics and have developed [several R packages](packages.qmd).
I also enjoy exploring the connections between theoretical mathematics and statistics---especially applications of algebraic topology and functional analysis.

When not working on research, I'm probably practicing aerial silks, bouldering, or reading.

<!-- Here are a few of my current projects that I'm excited to be working on: -->

<!-- -   [**ggdensity**](https://jamesotto852.github.io/ggdensity/): Interpretable visualizations of bivariate density estimates -->
<!-- -   [**tldr**](https://github.com/jamesotto852/tldr): Short-form documentation in the R console -->
<!-- -   [An Interactive History of Magic the Gathering](https://jamesotto.app/MTG-History) -->
